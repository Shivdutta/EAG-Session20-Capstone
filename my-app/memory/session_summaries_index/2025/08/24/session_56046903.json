The SIPGoalPlannerAgent has already been called and has generated the necessary JSON outputs (goal_input_json, inflation_adjusted_json, sip_calc_json, allocation_plan_json). Now, the remaining SIP chain needs to be assembled, including retrieval, distillation, QA, charts, and report generation. I will create the nodes and edges as specified in the SIP chain template, ensuring that the outputs from T001 are used as inputs for the subsequent tasks. I will also ensure all dependencies are correctly set, so there's no race condition between the Agents. The goal is to generate a final report with the required data.",

All agents are stateless, and I am providing all required inputs, including the outputs from T001, to the subsequent agents. I am providing the output file name. The plan will run in parallel if all dependencies are completed, and I have created appropriate dependencies for CoderAgent. I am not assuming any unknown file contents/business models/technical environments. All dependency relationships are correctly modeled with simple task IDs. The plan is granular and detailed enough. I have trusted CoderAgent with larger tasks and avoided micromanaging it. I am not using any simple or shortcut words like simple, easy, quick, etc. For the fund recommendation task, I am creating a fund category.",

This aligns with the predefined policy where a 'Moderate' risk profile corresponds to a balanced mix of 50% equity and 50% debt. The `recommended_fund_categories` for equity (Large Cap Index, Flexi Cap, Multi Cap) and debt (Short Duration, Corporate Bond, Liquid) are retained as initially defined.  The fund shortlist provided in T012 contains limited and incomplete data regarding specific funds, preventing a detailed fund selection or validation process.  Therefore, the primary focus remains on adhering to the established asset allocation policy based on the 'Moderate' risk appetite and confirming the overall suitability of the fund categories. The generated configuration object provides essential parameters for downstream calculations, specifically for SIP calculations and inflation adjustments. The annual return percentage is mapped to 10% based on the 'Moderate' risk appetite as defined in the initial instructions.  The confirmation of the allocation plan and the generation of the configuration object are performed under the constraint of limited fund data, and any further fund-specific recommendations would require a more comprehensive fund dataset.",

The SIPGoalPlannerAgent has already been called and has generated the necessary JSON outputs (goal_input_json, inflation_adjusted_json, sip_calc_json, allocation_plan_json). Now, the remaining SIP chain needs to be assembled, including retrieval, distillation, QA, charts, and report generation. I will create the nodes and edges as specified in the SIP chain template, ensuring that the outputs from T001 are used as inputs for the subsequent tasks. I will also ensure all dependencies are correctly set, so there's no race condition between the Agents. The goal is to generate a final report with the required data.",

All agents are stateless, and I am providing all required inputs, including the outputs from T001, to the subsequent agents. I am providing the output file name. The plan will run in parallel if all dependencies are completed, and I have created appropriate dependencies for CoderAgent. I am not assuming any unknown file contents/business models/technical environments. All dependency relationships are correctly modeled with simple task IDs. The plan is granular and detailed enough. I have trusted CoderAgent with larger tasks and avoided micromanaging it. I am not using any simple or shortcut words like simple, easy, quick, etc. For the fund recommendation task, I am creating a fund category.",

This aligns with the predefined policy where a 'Moderate' risk profile corresponds to a balanced mix of 50% equity and 50% debt. The `recommended_fund_categories` for equity (Large Cap Index, Flexi Cap, Multi Cap) and debt (Short Duration, Corporate Bond, Liquid) are retained as initially defined.  The fund shortlist provided in T012 contains limited and incomplete data regarding specific funds, preventing a detailed fund selection or validation process.  Therefore, the primary focus remains on adhering to the established asset allocation policy based on the 'Moderate' risk appetite and confirming the overall suitability of the fund categories. The generated configuration object provides essential parameters for downstream calculations, specifically for SIP calculations and inflation adjustments. The annual return percentage is mapped to 10% based on the 'Moderate' risk appetite as defined in the initial instructions.  The confirmation of the allocation plan and the generation of the configuration object are performed under the constraint of limited fund data, and any further fund-specific recommendations would require a more comprehensive fund dataset.",
