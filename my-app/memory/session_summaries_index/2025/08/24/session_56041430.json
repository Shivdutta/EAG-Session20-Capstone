What is average maturity and how is it useful? Why is it essential to match the investment horizon with that of the scheme? A debt fund is a mutual fund scheme that invests in fixed income instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds, corporate debt securities, and money market instruments etc. that offer capital appreciation. Debt funds are also referred to as Income Funds or Bond Funds. Debt funds are ideal for investors who want regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Term Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt mutual funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve your financial goals in a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns. Debt funds invest in either listed or unlisted debt instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds at a certain price and later sell them at a margin. The difference between the cost and sale price accounts for the appreciation or depreciation in the funds net asset value (NAV). Debt funds also receive periodic interest from the underlying debt instruments in which they invest. In terms                   of return, debt funds that earn regular interest from the fixed income instruments during the funds tenure are similar to bank fixed deposits that earn interest. This interest income gets added to a debt fund on a                   daily basis. If the interest payment is received, say, once every year, it is divided by 365 and the debt funds NAV goes up daily by this small amount. Thus, a debt schemes NAV also depends on the interest rates of                   its underlying assets and also on any upgrade or downgrade in the credit rating of its holdings. Market prices of debt securities change with movements in interest rates. Lets assume, your debt fund owns a security that yields 10 % interest. If the interest rate in the economy falls, new instruments issued in the                   market would offer this lower rate. To match this lower rate, there would be an increase in the prices your funds underlying instruments as they have a higher coupon (intere', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/personal-finance/debt-mutual-funds-february-amfi-data-outflows-factors-liquid-short-term-schemes-19572577.htm', 'content': 'Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February - CNBC TV18 Join Us Log in / Sign up Become a Member Language English Latest news Live Updates Markets Business Personal Finance Economy India World Upcoming Events Engage with CNBC-TV18 Photos Videos Minis Web Stories Polls Quiz Healthcare Politics Travel Education & Careers Sports Views Auto Entertainment Technology Startups Lifestyle Retail Real Estate Minis Special Coverage India Business Leader Awards Branded Content HealthX Elevate India Retirement Insights Summit The Growth Summit Ceo awards Accelerate Your Cloud Journey Accelerating to a Connected Future Financial Services Cloud Symposium Crypto Education Next Ey Entrepreneur Of The Year IRMA Wizards of finance The Thought League Discover CNBCTV18 About Contact Advertise Disclaimer Terms of Use Privacy Policy Shows Anchors Polls 11:11 Newsletter Life Watch Live TV Latest News New #HealthXElevate New #NavigateWithHSBC #NiveshKaSahiKadam New SME Champions Season 2 Home Personal Finance News Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. By Anshul March 12, 2025, 2:07:44 PM IST (Published) 2 Min Read Debt mutual funds witnessed net outflows of 6,525.56 crore in February 2025, reversing from strong inflows of 1,28,652.58 crore in January. Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. Category-wise performance Outflows: Ultra-short duration funds: 4,281.02 crore Overnight funds and low-duration funds: 2,263.94 crore Money market funds: 275.96 crore Inflows: Liquid funds: 4,976.97 crore Corporate bond funds: 1,064.83 crore Short-duration funds: 473.53 crore Reasons behind the outflows Nehal Meshram, Senior Analyst Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, attributed the redemptions to investors rebalancing portfolios. \"10 out of 16 debt fund categories saw outflows, primarily in short-duration funds. These accounted for 90% of total redemptions,\" Meshram said. She noted that some investors may be shifting to longer-duration bonds in anticipation of interest rate cuts by the RBI. \"Medium to long duration and gilt funds saw marginal inflows, reflecting investor positioning for potential capital appreciation. Gilt funds remain attractive due to their low credit risk and sovereign backing,\" she added. Market outlook Debt fund flows may stabilize as market conditions evolve. Interest rate movements and inflation trends will be key factors influencing investor sentiment in the coming months. Other category performance On the other hand, New fund offers (NFOs) collected 4,029 crore, compared to 4,544 crore in the previous month. Gold ETFs recorded inflows of 1,980 crore, down from 3,751.4 crore. Sectoral and thematic funds saw inflows of 5,711.6 crore, lower than 9,016.6 crore in January.

Also known as Short Term Income Funds, Short term debt funds invest in debt instruments and money market instruments that include Bank papers (also called Certificate of Deposits), government papers(G-secs) and commercial papers (CPs). This Mutual Fund scheme is suitable for investors who prioritise Capital preservation, but also wish to invest for a predominantly longer period to earn good returns over the long term (between 1-3 years). Investors who are willing to invest for a short duration of 1-3 years can look at short term bond funds. Short term debt products can benefit from the interest Accruals in the debt Portfolio and from the tactical exposure to higher duration debt by the respective fund manager. Ready to Invest?

Processing... Get Started Features of Short Duration (Short-Term) Debt Funds Some of the prominent features of short term funds are: Liquidity The short term debt funds are highly liquid as the maturity period is short and the investments avenues allow liquidity . Usually, there are no entry and exit loads charged on these funds. However, some short term debt funds do charge an exit load if the exit is made in a few months. So, the investors are suggested to invest wisely considering all the parameters. Returns When it comes to investing in Mutual Funds , returns are what people actually look for. However, this should not be the only parameter while choosing a best short term Debt fund to invest. In the recent reports, RBI stated that the investors would earn better returns by Investing in short to mid-term funds that invest in instruments having a maturity between of one to five years. Generally, the fund managers handling such funds prefer investing in high credit rating securities. Thus, ensuring the least possibility of Default by the issuers providing safety to investors capital. Currently, short term debt funds with a maturity period of one-three years give annualised returns of 9-10% p.a. Investors should not just chase returns, but also look at the credit quality of the portfolio. If you are a conservative investor then it makes sense to ensure that give away some returns for the extra safety. Interest Rate Risk Given the short term nature of these funds, the returns are not much affected by Inflation and there is a lesser interest rate risk. Typically, short term debt funds generate income from the interest earned on short to medium term Bonds . This accrual income, meaning the accumulated interest, gets added to the Net Asset Value and becomes your final return. Since you know these funds provide steady income, therefore, the returns a', 'images': [{'url': 'https://d28wu8o6itv89t.cloudfront.net/images/Riskinshorttermfundspng-1512475762127.png', 'alt_text': 'Risk-In-Short-Term-Debt-Funds', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://d28wu8o6itv89t.cloudfront.net/images/Bestshortdurationjpg-1539091460243.jpeg', 'alt_text': '5 Best Short Duration (Short Term) Debt Funds To Invest In 2025', 'title': '5 Best Short Duration (Short Term) Debt Funds To Invest In 2025', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://d28wu8o6itv89t.cloudfront.net/images/MFSHpng-1538144088861.png', 'alt_text': '5 Best Ultra Short Term Debt Funds for SIP 2025', 'title': '5 Best Ultra Short Term Debt Funds for SIP 2025', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://d28wu8o6itv89t.cloudfront.net/images/MFSHpng-1538144088861.png', 'alt_text': 'Top 10 Best Performing Short Term Debt Funds for Year 2024', 'title': 'Top 10 Best Performing Short Term Debt Funds for Year 2024', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://d28wu8o6itv89t.cloudfront.net/images/ultravsdebtjpg-1539350132241.jpeg', 'alt_text': 'Ultra Short Term Funds Vs Liquid Funds', 'title': 'Ultra Short Term Funds Vs Liquid Funds', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.business-standard.com/finance/personal-finance/debt-funds-keep-bulk-of-portfolio-in-short-to-medium-duration-funds-125071600862_1.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.businesstoday.in/personal-finance/investment/story/debt-fund-inflows-were-down-by-62-in-august-where-should-you-invest-now-446749-2024-09-20', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/personal-finance/debt-mutual-funds-june-amfi-data-outflows-short-duration-liquid-money-market-inflows-19634094.htm', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

However, the fund shortlist from T012 primarily contains equity funds from PGIM India. To maintain the desired asset allocation, we'll keep the equity portion at 50% and suggest the client explore debt fund options from other providers, as the current data is limited to PGIM India for the available fund data.  The allocation plan includes diversification within the equity portion by selecting funds across different market caps. Given the lack of indicative ratings, the final fund selection should involve a more thorough due diligence process, potentially with the assistance of a financial advisor.  The initial 'Moderate' risk assessment maps to a 10% annual return.  Inflation is set to the default of 5.5%. The SIP calculation leverages standard financial formulas to determine required monthly contributions and project future value accounting for inflation. While a 50/50 allocation is maintained, there should be a greater focus on debt. The concentration of PGIM India funds on the equity side means that, to meet the allocation plan, other fund providers need to be explored for the debt component of the portfolio. This risk assessment should be performed either automatically or manually.",

The actual returns may vary from the expected returns.  Additionally, reliance on a limited fund shortlist from a single provider (PGIM India) can lead to sub-optimal diversification and increased concentration risk.  The absence of indicative ratings for the funds further compounds the risk, as it necessitates a more rigorous due diligence process. Inflation rates could deviate significantly from the assumed 5.5%, impacting the real value of the accumulated assets.  Changes in tax laws could also affect the returns from investments. Furthermore, the models used for SIP calculation and inflation adjustment rely on historical data and assumptions, which might not accurately predict future outcomes. The investor should be aware that financial models are not guarantees of future success and may be subject to errors or limitations. A comprehensive risk assessment, either automated or manual, should be regularly performed to adapt to changing market conditions and personal circumstances. The information provided should not be considered as financial advice, and consulting a qualified financial advisor is essential.</p></section><section><h2>Hidden Signals and Meta Observations</h2><p>The concentration of equity fund data from PGIM India suggests a need for broader market research to identify potentially better-performing or more diversified options. The absence of fund ratings highlights the importance of independent analysis and due diligence. It also indicates potential limitations in the available data, urging caution and further investigation.</p></section><section><h2>Source Citations</h2><p>SIP Calculation Formula: FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1)</p><p>Inflation Adjustment Formula: FV_inflated = FV*(1+i)^years</p><p>Data Sources: T001, T013, T015, T014</p></section><section><h2>Final Highlights and Recommendations</h2><p>Start the SIP with a monthly investment of INR 158,940. Maintain a 50/50 asset allocation between equity and debt. Diversify across different fund categories and providers. Regularly review and rebalance the portfolio. Consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.</p></section><script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js\"></script><script>const monthlyProjectionData = [{\"month\": 0,

The actual returns may vary from the expected returns.  Additionally, reliance on a limited fund shortlist from a single provider (PGIM India) can lead to sub-optimal diversification and increased concentration risk.  The absence of indicative ratings for the funds further compounds the risk, as it necessitates a more rigorous due diligence process. Inflation rates could deviate significantly from the assumed 5.5%, impacting the real value of the accumulated assets.  Changes in tax laws could also affect the returns from investments. Furthermore, the models used for SIP calculation and inflation adjustment rely on historical data and assumptions, which might not accurately predict future outcomes. The investor should be aware that financial models are not guarantees of future success and may be subject to errors or limitations. A comprehensive risk assessment, either automated or manual, should be regularly performed to adapt to changing market conditions and personal circumstances. The information provided should not be considered as financial advice, and consulting a qualified financial advisor is essential.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section class=\"mb-4\">\n                    <h2>Hidden Signals and Meta Observations</h2>\n                    <p>The concentration of equity fund data from PGIM India suggests a need for broader market research to identify potentially better-performing or more diversified options.

What is average maturity and how is it useful? Why is it essential to match the investment horizon with that of the scheme? A debt fund is a mutual fund scheme that invests in fixed income instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds, corporate debt securities, and money market instruments etc. that offer capital appreciation. Debt funds are also referred to as Income Funds or Bond Funds. Debt funds are ideal for investors who want regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Term Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt mutual funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve your financial goals in a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns. Debt funds invest in either listed or unlisted debt instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds at a certain price and later sell them at a margin. The difference between the cost and sale price accounts for the appreciation or depreciation in the funds net asset value (NAV). Debt funds also receive periodic interest from the underlying debt instruments in which they invest. In terms                   of return, debt funds that earn regular interest from the fixed income instruments during the funds tenure are similar to bank fixed deposits that earn interest. This interest income gets added to a debt fund on a                   daily basis. If the interest payment is received, say, once every year, it is divided by 365 and the debt funds NAV goes up daily by this small amount. Thus, a debt schemes NAV also depends on the interest rates of                   its underlying assets and also on any upgrade or downgrade in the credit rating of its holdings. Market prices of debt securities change with movements in interest rates. Lets assume, your debt fund owns a security that yields 10 % interest. If the interest rate in the economy falls, new instruments issued in the                   market would offer this lower rate. To match this lower rate, there would be an increase in the prices your funds underlying instruments as they have a higher coupon (intere', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/personal-finance/debt-mutual-funds-february-amfi-data-outflows-factors-liquid-short-term-schemes-19572577.htm', 'content': 'Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February - CNBC TV18 Join Us Log in / Sign up Become a Member Language English Latest news Live Updates Markets Business Personal Finance Economy India World Upcoming Events Engage with CNBC-TV18 Photos Videos Minis Web Stories Polls Quiz Healthcare Politics Travel Education & Careers Sports Views Auto Entertainment Technology Startups Lifestyle Retail Real Estate Minis Special Coverage India Business Leader Awards Branded Content HealthX Elevate India Retirement Insights Summit The Growth Summit Ceo awards Accelerate Your Cloud Journey Accelerating to a Connected Future Financial Services Cloud Symposium Crypto Education Next Ey Entrepreneur Of The Year IRMA Wizards of finance The Thought League Discover CNBCTV18 About Contact Advertise Disclaimer Terms of Use Privacy Policy Shows Anchors Polls 11:11 Newsletter Life Watch Live TV Latest News New #HealthXElevate New #NavigateWithHSBC #NiveshKaSahiKadam New SME Champions Season 2 Home Personal Finance News Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows.

Category-wise performance Outflows: Ultra-short duration funds: 4,281.02 crore Overnight funds and low-duration funds: 2,263.94 crore Money market funds: 275.96 crore Inflows: Liquid funds: 4,976.97 crore Corporate bond funds: 1,064.83 crore Short-duration funds: 473.53 crore Reasons behind the outflows Nehal Meshram, Senior Analyst Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, attributed the redemptions to investors rebalancing portfolios. \"10 out of 16 debt fund categories saw outflows, primarily in short-duration funds. These accounted for 90% of total redemptions,\" Meshram said. She noted that some investors may be shifting to longer-duration bonds in anticipation of interest rate cuts by the RBI. \"Medium to long duration and gilt funds saw marginal inflows, reflecting investor positioning for potential capital appreciation. Gilt funds remain attractive due to their low credit risk and sovereign backing,\" she added. Market outlook Debt fund flows may stabilize as market conditions evolve. Interest rate movements and inflation trends will be key factors influencing investor sentiment in the coming months. Other category performance On the other hand, New fund offers (NFOs) collected 4,029 crore, compared to 4,544 crore in the previous month. Gold ETFs recorded inflows of 1,980 crore, down from 3,751.4 crore. Sectoral and thematic funds saw inflows of 5,711.6 crore, lower than 9,016.6 crore in January.

Also known as Short Term Income Funds, Short term debt funds invest in debt instruments and money market instruments that include Bank papers (also called Certificate of Deposits), government papers(G-secs) and commercial papers (CPs). This Mutual Fund scheme is suitable for investors who prioritise Capital preservation, but also wish to invest for a predominantly longer period to earn good returns over the long term (between 1-3 years). Investors who are willing to invest for a short duration of 1-3 years can look at short term bond funds. Short term debt products can benefit from the interest Accruals in the debt Portfolio and from the tactical exposure to higher duration debt by the respective fund manager. Ready to Invest?

Processing... Get Started Features of Short Duration (Short-Term) Debt Funds Some of the prominent features of short term funds are: Liquidity The short term debt funds are highly liquid as the maturity period is short and the investments avenues allow liquidity . Usually, there are no entry and exit loads charged on these funds. However, some short term debt funds do charge an exit load if the exit is made in a few months. So, the investors are suggested to invest wisely considering all the parameters. Returns When it comes to investing in Mutual Funds , returns are what people actually look for. However, this should not be the only parameter while choosing a best short term Debt fund to invest. In the recent reports, RBI stated that the investors would earn better returns by Investing in short to mid-term funds that invest in instruments having a maturity between of one to five years. Generally, the fund managers handling such funds prefer investing in high credit rating securities. Thus, ensuring the least possibility of Default by the issuers providing safety to investors capital. Currently, short term debt funds with a maturity period of one-three years give annualised returns of 9-10% p.a. Investors should not just chase returns, but also look at the credit quality of the portfolio. If you are a conservative investor then it makes sense to ensure that give away some returns for the extra safety. Interest Rate Risk Given the short term nature of these funds, the returns are not much affected by Inflation and there is a lesser interest rate risk. Typically, short term debt funds generate income from the interest earned on short to medium term Bonds . This accrual income, meaning the accumulated interest, gets added to the Net Asset Value and becomes your final return. Since you know these funds provide steady income, therefore, the returns a', 'images': [{'url': 'https://d28wu8o6itv89t.cloudfront.net/images/Riskinshorttermfundspng-1512475762127.png', 'alt_text': 'Risk-In-Short-Term-Debt-Funds', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://d28wu8o6itv89t.cloudfront.net/images/Bestshortdurationjpg-1539091460243.jpeg', 'alt_text': '5 Best Short Duration (Short Term) Debt Funds To Invest In 2025', 'title': '5 Best Short Duration (Short Term) Debt Funds To Invest In 2025', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://d28wu8o6itv89t.cloudfront.net/images/MFSHpng-1538144088861.png', 'alt_text': '5 Best Ultra Short Term Debt Funds for SIP 2025', 'title': '5 Best Ultra Short Term Debt Funds for SIP 2025', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://d28wu8o6itv89t.cloudfront.net/images/MFSHpng-1538144088861.png', 'alt_text': 'Top 10 Best Performing Short Term Debt Funds for Year 2024', 'title': 'Top 10 Best Performing Short Term Debt Funds for Year 2024', 'confidence': 0.7}, {'url': 'https://d28wu8o6itv89t.cloudfront.net/images/ultravsdebtjpg-1539350132241.jpeg', 'alt_text': 'Ultra Short Term Funds Vs Liquid Funds', 'title': 'Ultra Short Term Funds Vs Liquid Funds', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 5}, {'url': 'https://www.business-standard.com/finance/personal-finance/debt-funds-keep-bulk-of-portfolio-in-short-to-medium-duration-funds-125071600862_1.html', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 6}, {'url': 'https://www.businesstoday.in/personal-finance/investment/story/debt-fund-inflows-were-down-by-62-in-august-where-should-you-invest-now-446749-2024-09-20', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 7}, {'url': 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/personal-finance/debt-mutual-funds-june-amfi-data-outflows-short-duration-liquid-money-market-inflows-19634094.htm', 'content': '[not extracted] Content limit reached', 'rank': 8}]",

However, the fund shortlist from T012 primarily contains equity funds from PGIM India. To maintain the desired asset allocation, we'll keep the equity portion at 50% and suggest the client explore debt fund options from other providers, as the current data is limited to PGIM India for the available fund data.  The allocation plan includes diversification within the equity portion by selecting funds across different market caps. Given the lack of indicative ratings, the final fund selection should involve a more thorough due diligence process, potentially with the assistance of a financial advisor.  The initial 'Moderate' risk assessment maps to a 10% annual return.  Inflation is set to the default of 5.5%. The SIP calculation leverages standard financial formulas to determine required monthly contributions and project future value accounting for inflation. While a 50/50 allocation is maintained, there should be a greater focus on debt. The concentration of PGIM India funds on the equity side means that, to meet the allocation plan, other fund providers need to be explored for the debt component of the portfolio. This risk assessment should be performed either automatically or manually.",

The absence of indicative ratings for the funds further compounds the risk, as it necessitates a more rigorous due diligence process. Inflation rates could deviate significantly from the assumed 5.5%, impacting the real value of the accumulated assets.  Changes in tax laws could also affect the returns from investments. Furthermore, the models used for SIP calculation and inflation adjustment rely on historical data and assumptions, which might not accurately predict future outcomes. The investor should be aware that financial models are not guarantees of future success and may be subject to errors or limitations. A comprehensive risk assessment, either automated or manual, should be regularly performed to adapt to changing market conditions and personal circumstances. The information provided should not be considered as financial advice, and consulting a qualified financial advisor is essential.</p></section><section><h2>Hidden Signals and Meta Observations</h2><p>The concentration of equity fund data from PGIM India suggests a need for broader market research to identify potentially better-performing or more diversified options. The absence of fund ratings highlights the importance of independent analysis and due diligence. It also indicates potential limitations in the available data, urging caution and further investigation.</p></section><section><h2>Source Citations</h2><p>SIP Calculation Formula: FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1)</p><p>Inflation Adjustment Formula: FV_inflated = FV*(1+i)^years</p><p>Data Sources: T001, T013, T015, T014</p></section><section><h2>Final Highlights and Recommendations</h2><p>Start the SIP with a monthly investment of INR 158,940. Maintain a 50/50 asset allocation between equity and debt. Diversify across different fund categories and providers. Regularly review and rebalance the portfolio.

The actual returns may vary from the expected returns.  Additionally, reliance on a limited fund shortlist from a single provider (PGIM India) can lead to sub-optimal diversification and increased concentration risk.  The absence of indicative ratings for the funds further compounds the risk, as it necessitates a more rigorous due diligence process. Inflation rates could deviate significantly from the assumed 5.5%, impacting the real value of the accumulated assets.  Changes in tax laws could also affect the returns from investments. Furthermore, the models used for SIP calculation and inflation adjustment rely on historical data and assumptions, which might not accurately predict future outcomes. The investor should be aware that financial models are not guarantees of future success and may be subject to errors or limitations. A comprehensive risk assessment, either automated or manual, should be regularly performed to adapt to changing market conditions and personal circumstances. The information provided should not be considered as financial advice, and consulting a qualified financial advisor is essential.</p>\n                </section>\n                <section class=\"mb-4\">\n                    <h2>Hidden Signals and Meta Observations</h2>\n                    <p>The concentration of equity fund data from PGIM India suggests a need for broader market research to identify potentially better-performing or more diversified options.
