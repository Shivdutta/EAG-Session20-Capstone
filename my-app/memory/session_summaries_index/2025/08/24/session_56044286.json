Since T001 is already completed, I need to assemble the rest of the SIP chain (retrieval → distillation → QA → charts → report → scheduler) as outlined in the instructions. I'll use the outputs from T001 as inputs for these tasks. The dependencies will ensure a smooth workflow.I am skipping  T002 ClarificationAgent and T003 ThinkerAgent since they are not required after T001. The main plan is to create RetrieverAgent for data collection, DistillerAgent for shortlisting funds, ThinkerAgent for allocation plan, QAAgent for quality checks, CoderAgent for generating charts and HTML snippets, FormatterAgent for report formatting, ReportGeneratorAgent for packaging HTML, and SchedulerAgent for optional monthly refresh. It is important that all these steps work together to produce a comprehensive SIP plan with charts and a final report. Need to remember all agents are stateless and the outputs of T001 must be passed down.",

T011 will fetch fund data, T012 will shortlist funds, T013 will reconcile shortlist with allocation categories, T014 will perform quality checks, T015 will generate charts and HTML snippets, T016 will format the report, T017 will package the final HTML file, and T018 will schedule optional monthly refresh. The edges will connect these tasks in a sequential manner to ensure data flows correctly.",

Each node has a clear description, agent assignment, and prompt. Dependencies are correctly modeled using task IDs. The plan is granular and detailed, suitable for a high-quality consulting project. I am passing all the outputs of T001 to each agent. I have avoided micromanaging the CoderAgent. I am generating Report after HTML formatting, which is allowed. I have considered all rules and constraints. No unknown file contents assumed. All agents are stateless, so outputs are being passed correctly.",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The allocation plan is confirmed and tweaked based on the Moderate risk appetite specified in T001's `goal_input_json`. The annual return percentage is mapped to 10% as per the provided risk appetite policy. The monthly return rate is calculated by dividing the annual return by 12 and then by 100 to convert it to a decimal (10/12/100 = 0.008333). The default inflation rate is set to 5.5% as no override was specified. The allocation plan maintains a 50/50 split between equity and debt, aligning with the Moderate risk appetite policy.\n\nThe fund shortlist from T012 is used as context. Specifically, the 'Large Cap' category has the most funds listed, influencing the decision to maintain 'Large Cap Index' as a primary recommendation within the equity allocation. The debt recommendations remain consistent with 'Short Duration', 'Corporate Bond', and 'Liquid' categories, as these generally align with a moderate-risk debt portfolio. The allocation rationale directly references the risk appetite and associated policy, and integrates the shortlist data by acknowledging the prominence of 'Large Cap' funds.\n\nThe risk of potentially misleading users with fixed allocation percentages is mitigated by the inclusion of recommended fund categories. This encourages users to explore specific fund options within equity and debt, rather than rigidly adhering to the overall percentages. The formula notes are also included for clarity, allowing users to understand the calculations behind the SIP and inflation adjustments.\n\nFurther improvements would involve incorporating a dynamic risk assessment to allow users to tweak the allocation percentages based on their specific risk preferences, or dynamically adjusting the portfolio based on prevailing market conditions. More specific funds could be recommended from the given Shortlist.\n\n**Math Engine Config:**\n\nThe math engine config contains parameters for SIP and inflation calculations. The `annual_return_pct` is set to 10 based on the Moderate risk appetite. The `monthly_return_r` is derived from `annual_return_pct`. The inflation rate is defaulted to 5.5%.\n\n**Allocation Rationale:**\n\nThe `allocation_plan_json` specifies the percentage split between equity and debt. It also lists recommended fund categories based on the moderate risk appetite, and influenced by the available Large Cap funds.\n\n**Fund Shortlist Integration:**\n\nSpecific funds are NOT added to the output to keep it generic, but the existence and information of the funds *was* considered in the decision making process.",

I'll use the outputs from T001 as inputs for these tasks. The dependencies will ensure a smooth workflow.I am skipping  T002 ClarificationAgent and T003 ThinkerAgent since they are not required after T001. The main plan is to create RetrieverAgent for data collection, DistillerAgent for shortlisting funds, ThinkerAgent for allocation plan, QAAgent for quality checks, CoderAgent for generating charts and HTML snippets, FormatterAgent for report formatting, ReportGeneratorAgent for packaging HTML, and SchedulerAgent for optional monthly refresh. It is important that all these steps work together to produce a comprehensive SIP plan with charts and a final report.

I am passing all the outputs of T001 to each agent. I have avoided micromanaging the CoderAgent. I am generating Report after HTML formatting, which is allowed.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The allocation plan is confirmed and tweaked based on the Moderate risk appetite specified in T001's `goal_input_json`. The annual return percentage is mapped to 10% as per the provided risk appetite policy. The monthly return rate is calculated by dividing the annual return by 12 and then by 100 to convert it to a decimal (10/12/100 = 0.008333). The default inflation rate is set to 5.5% as no override was specified. The allocation plan maintains a 50/50 split between equity and debt, aligning with the Moderate risk appetite policy.\n\nThe fund shortlist from T012 is used as context. Specifically, the 'Large Cap' category has the most funds listed, influencing the decision to maintain 'Large Cap Index' as a primary recommendation within the equity allocation. The debt recommendations remain consistent with 'Short Duration', 'Corporate Bond', and 'Liquid' categories, as these generally align with a moderate-risk debt portfolio. The allocation rationale directly references the risk appetite and associated policy, and integrates the shortlist data by acknowledging the prominence of 'Large Cap' funds.\n\nThe risk of potentially misleading users with fixed allocation percentages is mitigated by the inclusion of recommended fund categories. This encourages users to explore specific fund options within equity and debt, rather than rigidly adhering to the overall percentages. The formula notes are also included for clarity, allowing users to understand the calculations behind the SIP and inflation adjustments.\n\nFurther improvements would involve incorporating a dynamic risk assessment to allow users to tweak the allocation percentages based on their specific risk preferences, or dynamically adjusting the portfolio based on prevailing market conditions. More specific funds could be recommended from the given Shortlist.\n\n**Math Engine Config:**\n\nThe math engine config contains parameters for SIP and inflation calculations. The `annual_return_pct` is set to 10 based on the Moderate risk appetite. The `monthly_return_r` is derived from `annual_return_pct`. The inflation rate is defaulted to 5.5%.\n\n**Allocation Rationale:**\n\nThe `allocation_plan_json` specifies the percentage split between equity and debt. It also lists recommended fund categories based on the moderate risk appetite, and influenced by the available Large Cap funds.\n\n**Fund Shortlist Integration:**\n\nSpecific funds are NOT added to the output to keep it generic, but the existence and information of the funds *was* considered in the decision making process.",
