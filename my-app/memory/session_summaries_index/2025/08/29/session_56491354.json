I have been depending on the interest from these deposits for my day to day expenses. Since Bank deposit rates have moved down sharply, my income will get reduced by 25% plus if I renew these deposits. Where should I invest now to get a regular quarterly income of around 8.5% plus to sustain my expenses? Reply Team PaisaBazaar July 8, 2020 Hi Bhaskar, A couple of small finance banks are offering interest rates of 8.5-9.00% p.a. on some of their FD tenures. Given your age and cash flow profiles, income certainty and capital protection would be your primary concern. Hence, we suggest you open FDs in those banks with a quarterly payout option.

The allocation plan specifies 70% equity and 30% debt. The recommended fund categories for equity are Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap, while for debt, they are Corporate Bond and Short Duration. Examining the T012 shortlist, we find funds listed under Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap, and Corporate Bond categories. The key discrepancy is the absence of 'Short Duration' debt funds. This omission can significantly impact the overall asset allocation strategy, particularly concerning the debt component. The absence of short-duration funds may lead to a higher duration and interest rate risk for the debt portion of the portfolio. \n\nTo address this, either 'Short Duration' funds need to be added to the shortlist, or the asset allocation needs to be adjusted based on the available fund categories. If 'Short Duration' funds cannot be readily identified and added to the list, the debt allocation could be concentrated in 'Corporate Bond' funds. Given the high risk appetite (T001), one could consider slightly increasing the equity allocation to compensate, contingent on risk assessment.\n\nIt is vital to ensure downstream agents understand the implications of the missing 'Short Duration' category. The allocation plan should reflect the actual distribution across the available categories. For instance, the 'allocation_plan_json' should be updated to reflect the actual equity/debt split if 'Short Duration' funds are unavailable.",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The primary task is to validate the fund shortlist (T012) against the asset allocation plan (T001). The allocation plan specifies 70% equity and 30% debt. The recommended fund categories for equity are Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap, while for debt, they are Corporate Bond and Short Duration. Examining the T012 shortlist, we find funds listed under Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap, and Corporate Bond categories. The key discrepancy is the absence of 'Short Duration' debt funds. This omission can significantly impact the overall asset allocation strategy, particularly concerning the debt component. The absence of short-duration funds may lead to a higher duration and interest rate risk for the debt portion of the portfolio. \n\nTo address this, either 'Short Duration' funds need to be added to the shortlist, or the asset allocation needs to be adjusted based on the available fund categories. If 'Short Duration' funds cannot be readily identified and added to the list, the debt allocation could be concentrated in 'Corporate Bond' funds. Given the high risk appetite (T001), one could consider slightly increasing the equity allocation to compensate, contingent on risk assessment.\n\nIt is vital to ensure downstream agents understand the implications of the missing 'Short Duration' category. The allocation plan should reflect the actual distribution across the available categories. For instance, the 'allocation_plan_json' should be updated to reflect the actual equity/debt split if 'Short Duration' funds are unavailable.",
