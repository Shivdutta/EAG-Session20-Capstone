What is average maturity and how is it useful? Why is it essential to match the investment horizon with that of the scheme? A debt fund is a mutual fund scheme that invests in fixed income instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds, corporate debt securities, and money market instruments etc. that offer capital appreciation. Debt funds are also referred to as Income Funds or Bond Funds. Debt funds are ideal for investors who want regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Term Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt mutual funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve your financial goals in a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns. Debt funds invest in either listed or unlisted debt instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds at a certain price and later sell them at a margin. The difference between the cost and sale price accounts for the appreciation or depreciation in the funds net asset value (NAV). Debt funds also receive periodic interest from the underlying debt instruments in which they invest. In terms                   of return, debt funds that earn regular interest from the fixed income instruments during the funds tenure are similar to bank fixed deposits that earn interest. This interest income gets added to a debt fund on a                   daily basis. If the interest payment is received, say, once every year, it is divided by 365 and the debt funds NAV goes up daily by this small amount. Thus, a debt schemes NAV also depends on the interest rates of                   its underlying assets and also on any upgrade or downgrade in the credit rating of its holdings. Market prices of debt securities change with movements in interest rates. Lets assume, your debt fund owns a security that yields 10 % interest. If the interest rate in the economy falls, new instruments issued in the                   market would offer this lower rate. To match this lower rate, there would be an increase in the prices your funds underlying instruments as they have a higher coupon (intere', 'images': [], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/personal-finance/debt-mutual-funds-february-amfi-data-outflows-factors-liquid-short-term-schemes-19572577.htm', 'content': 'Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February - CNBC TV18 Join Us Log in / Sign up Become a Member Language English Latest news Live Updates Markets Business Personal Finance Economy India World Upcoming Events Engage with CNBC-TV18 Photos Videos Minis Web Stories Polls Quiz Healthcare Politics Travel Education & Careers Sports Views Auto Entertainment Technology Startups Lifestyle Retail Real Estate Minis Special Coverage India Business Leader Awards Branded Content HealthX Elevate India Retirement Insights Summit The Growth Summit Ceo awards Accelerate Your Cloud Journey Accelerating to a Connected Future Financial Services Cloud Symposium Crypto Education Next Ey Entrepreneur Of The Year IRMA Wizards of finance The Thought League Discover CNBCTV18 About Contact Advertise Disclaimer Terms of Use Privacy Policy Shows Anchors Polls 11:11 Newsletter Life Watch Live TV Latest News New #HealthXElevate New #NavigateWithHSBC #NiveshKaSahiKadam New SME Champions Season 2 Home Personal Finance News Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. By Anshul March 12, 2025, 2:07:44 PM IST (Published) 2 Min Read Debt mutual funds witnessed net outflows of 6,525.56 crore in February 2025, reversing from strong inflows of 1,28,652.58 crore in January. Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. Category-wise performance Outflows: Ultra-short duration funds: 4,281.02 crore Overnight funds and low-duration funds: 2,263.94 crore Money market funds: 275.96 crore Inflows: Liquid funds: 4,976.97 crore Corporate bond funds: 1,064.83 crore Short-duration funds: 473.53 crore Reasons behind the outflows Nehal Meshram, Senior Analyst Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, attributed the redemptions to investors rebalancing portfolios. \"10 out of 16 debt fund categories saw outflows, primarily in short-duration funds. These accounted for 90% of total redemptions,\" Meshram said. She noted that some investors may be shifting to longer-duration bonds in anticipation of interest rate cuts by the RBI. \"Medium to long duration and gilt funds saw marginal inflows, reflecting investor positioning for potential capital appreciation. Gilt funds remain attractive due to their low credit risk and sovereign backing,\" she added. Market outlook Debt fund flows may stabilize as market conditions evolve. Interest rate movements and inflation trends will be key factors influencing investor sentiment in the coming months. Other category performance On the other hand, New fund offers (NFOs) collected 4,029 crore, compared to 4,544 crore in the previous month. Gold ETFs recorded inflows of 1,980 crore, down from 3,751.4 crore. Sectoral and thematic funds saw inflows of 5,711.6 crore, lower than 9,016.6 crore in January.

What is average maturity and how is it useful? Why is it essential to match the investment horizon with that of the scheme? A debt fund is a mutual fund scheme that invests in fixed income instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds, corporate debt securities, and money market instruments etc. that offer capital appreciation. Debt funds are also referred to as Income Funds or Bond Funds. Debt funds are ideal for investors who want regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Term Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt mutual funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve your financial goals in a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns. Debt funds invest in either listed or unlisted debt instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds at a certain price and later sell them at a margin. The difference between the cost and sale price accounts for the appreciation or depreciation in the funds net asset value (NAV). Debt funds also receive periodic interest from the underlying debt instruments in which they invest. In terms                   of return, debt funds that earn regular interest from the fixed income instruments during the funds tenure are similar to bank fixed deposits that earn interest. This interest income gets added to a debt fund on a                   daily basis. If the interest payment is received, say, once every year, it is divided by 365 and the debt funds NAV goes up daily by this small amount. Thus, a debt schemes NAV also depends on the interest rates of                   its underlying assets and also on any upgrade or downgrade in the credit rating of its holdings. Market prices of debt securities change with movements in interest rates. Lets assume, your debt fund owns a security that yields 10 % interest. If the interest rate in the economy falls, new instruments issued in the                   market would offer this lower rate. To match this lower rate, there would be an increase in the prices your funds underlying instruments as they have a higher coupon (intere', 'images': [], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/personal-finance/debt-mutual-funds-february-amfi-data-outflows-factors-liquid-short-term-schemes-19572577.htm', 'content': 'Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February - CNBC TV18 Join Us Log in / Sign up Become a Member Language English Latest news Live Updates Markets Business Personal Finance Economy India World Upcoming Events Engage with CNBC-TV18 Photos Videos Minis Web Stories Polls Quiz Healthcare Politics Travel Education & Careers Sports Views Auto Entertainment Technology Startups Lifestyle Retail Real Estate Minis Special Coverage India Business Leader Awards Branded Content HealthX Elevate India Retirement Insights Summit The Growth Summit Ceo awards Accelerate Your Cloud Journey Accelerating to a Connected Future Financial Services Cloud Symposium Crypto Education Next Ey Entrepreneur Of The Year IRMA Wizards of finance The Thought League Discover CNBCTV18 About Contact Advertise Disclaimer Terms of Use Privacy Policy Shows Anchors Polls 11:11 Newsletter Life Watch Live TV Latest News New #HealthXElevate New #NavigateWithHSBC #NiveshKaSahiKadam New SME Champions Season 2 Home Personal Finance News Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. By Anshul March 12, 2025, 2:07:44 PM IST (Published) 2 Min Read Debt mutual funds witnessed net outflows of 6,525.56 crore in February 2025, reversing from strong inflows of 1,28,652.58 crore in January. Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. Category-wise performance Outflows: Ultra-short duration funds: 4,281.02 crore Overnight funds and low-duration funds: 2,263.94 crore Money market funds: 275.96 crore Inflows: Liquid funds: 4,976.97 crore Corporate bond funds: 1,064.83 crore Short-duration funds: 473.53 crore Reasons behind the outflows Nehal Meshram, Senior Analyst Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, attributed the redemptions to investors rebalancing portfolios. \"10 out of 16 debt fund categories saw outflows, primarily in short-duration funds. These accounted for 90% of total redemptions,\" Meshram said. She noted that some investors may be shifting to longer-duration bonds in anticipation of interest rate cuts by the RBI. \"Medium to long duration and gilt funds saw marginal inflows, reflecting investor positioning for potential capital appreciation. Gilt funds remain attractive due to their low credit risk and sovereign backing,\" she added. Market outlook Debt fund flows may stabilize as market conditions evolve. Interest rate movements and inflation trends will be key factors influencing investor sentiment in the coming months. Other category performance On the other hand, New fund offers (NFOs) collected 4,029 crore, compared to 4,544 crore in the previous month. Gold ETFs recorded inflows of 1,980 crore, down from 3,751.4 crore. Sectoral and thematic funds saw inflows of 5,711.6 crore, lower than 9,016.6 crore in January.
