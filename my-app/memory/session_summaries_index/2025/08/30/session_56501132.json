Based on the 'high' risk appetite specified in T001, the following configurations are generated. The `annual_return_pct` is set to 12, corresponding to the 'high' risk appetite mapping. The `monthly_return_r` is calculated as `annual_return_pct/12/100`. The `inflation_pct` defaults to 5.5, as not overridden by the user. The asset allocation plan aligns with the 'high' risk appetite, allocating 70% to equity and 30% to debt, as specified in T001. The fund shortlist from T012 is considered as a preliminary list of potential funds and requires further vetting before recommendation. The equity allocation can be fulfilled by funds in the 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', and 'Small Cap' categories. The debt allocation can be fulfilled by funds in the 'Short Term Debt' and 'Corporate Bond' categories. It's important to note the limitations of the fund shortlist due to incomplete data extraction, which emphasizes the need for dedicated fund data APIs. The SIP is already calculated in T001 and thus no calculations will be redone here. The monthly SIP is 240332.25 with an adjusted target of 51265897.32 over 120 months.",

Based on the 'high' risk appetite specified in T001, the following configurations are generated. The `annual_return_pct` is set to 12, corresponding to the 'high' risk appetite mapping. The `monthly_return_r` is calculated as `annual_return_pct/12/100`. The `inflation_pct` defaults to 5.5, as not overridden by the user. The asset allocation plan aligns with the 'high' risk appetite, allocating 70% to equity and 30% to debt, as specified in T001. The fund shortlist from T012 is considered as a preliminary list of potential funds and requires further vetting before recommendation. The equity allocation can be fulfilled by funds in the 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', and 'Small Cap' categories. The debt allocation can be fulfilled by funds in the 'Short Term Debt' and 'Corporate Bond' categories. It's important to note the limitations of the fund shortlist due to incomplete data extraction, which emphasizes the need for dedicated fund data APIs. The SIP is already calculated in T001 and thus no calculations will be redone here. The monthly SIP is 240332.25 with an adjusted target of 51265897.32 over 120 months.",
