To ensure that all equity schemes follow uniform definitions for defining large, mid, and small caps, the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) has defined them as follows: Large-cap companies 1st to 100th company in terms of market cap Mid-cap companies 101st to 250th company in terms of market cap Small-cap companies 251st company onwards in terms of market cap This is the basic Difference Between Large Cap, Mid Cap, And Small Cap stocks. I crunched the numbers from the latest data ( link ). The following table summarizes it: Here is a simpler explanation of the table above: The top 100 stocks, which are called largecaps, now form 64.4% of the overall marketcap of all the Indian stocks. The midcap and smallcaps have 17.8% allocation each in the overall pie. Interestingly, the minimum marketcap needed now to qualify as a largecap is Rs 67,018 Cr. The same figure for midcaps is Rs 21,994 Cr. So compared to just a few years back, many midcaps are now size of yesteryear largecaps! A while back I wrote that whether it made sense for SEBI to widen definitions to increase the number of large and mid-cap stocks? May be it is an idea worth considering now given so much money (via SIP inflows) following just a few hundred stocks.

The risk level of a debt fund depends on two factors: who the money is lent to and for how long. Debt funds can be considered for an investment horizon of 1 day to up to 3 years. They offer better post-tax returns compared to FDs if you stay invested for at least 3 years. Liquid debt funds are a great option to park your emergency funds.

Mutual funds seen favouring short-term Indian corporate debt after inflows hit 2-year high INDIA-BONDS/CORPORATE DEBT:Mutual funds seen favouring short-term Indian corporate debt after inflows hit 2-year high Reuters Published 11 Jun 2025, 03:13 PM IST Mutual funds seen favouring short-term Indian corporate debt after inflows hit 2-year high By Dharamraj Dhutia MUMBAI, June 11 (Reuters) - Mutual funds are expected to increase purchases of short-term Indian corporate bonds in the coming weeks, according to fund managers, after inflows into corporate bond schemes hit a two-year high in May amid surplus liquidity. Corporate bond funds recorded net inflows of 119.8 billion rupees ($1.40 billion) last month, more than triple of April\\'s total and the highest since March 2023, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). \"Liquidity is in surplus so there could be some flows, but investments should shift in the up to three-year segment as yields on other segments are expected to rise more,\" said Akhil Mittal, senior fixed income fund manager at Tata Asset Management.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the allocation plan (T001), a 70/30 equity/debt split is desired, reflecting a high-risk appetite. The fund shortlist (T012) presents a limited selection of funds. \n\n**Equity Allocation (70%):**\nGiven the constraints, the following funds are recommended for the equity portion:\n*   **UTI Aggressive Hybrid Fund Regular Plan-Growth (Hybrid):** This fund provides a blend of equity and debt, aligning with the aggressive risk appetite, offering a 5Y return of 19.04%.\n*   **HSBC Large Cap Fund Direct-Growth (Large Cap):** Aligns directly with the recommended 'Large Cap' category and offers a 5Y return of 18.15%.\n\n**Debt Allocation (30%):**\nThe following funds are recommended for the debt portion, considering their relatively short-term nature and returns:\n*   **Bank of India Short Term Income Fund (Debt: Short Duration):** Providing a 1Y return of 9.95% p.a. offering shorter-term stability.\n*   **Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 1-3 year Bond ETFs FoF (Debt: International Debt):** Offering a 1Y return of 9.58% p.a., providing diversification by investing in US treasury bonds.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe selection prioritizes funds that align with the recommended equity and debt categories in the allocation plan. Return percentages are used as a simple comparative metric due to the lack of indicative ratings. The hybrid fund acts as an equity fund allocation given the lack of Small and Mid-Cap funds in the shortlist.\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe fund shortlist is limited, lacking a strong selection of Mid-Cap and Small-Cap equity funds. Indicative ratings are missing, and the return percentages are used as a simplified metric. Furthermore, selecting only two debt funds concentrates the debt allocation significantly. The fund return percentages are not inflation-adjusted. There is a risk due to the concentration of funds overall and the limitation of selection.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nIt is strongly recommended to retrieve data from fund-specific sources to obtain performance metrics, ratings, and expense ratios for a more thorough analysis. Expand the fund selection beyond the shortlist to include a wider range of options across all recommended categories, especially Mid-Cap and Small-Cap. Consider a tool/API that provides a larger and more varied list of Funds.\n\n**Risk Factors and Uncertainties:**\nThe recommendations are based on a limited dataset and may not reflect a comprehensive view of the available investment options. Changes in market conditions and fund performance can significantly impact the actual returns and overall portfolio performance. The historical return data is not indicative of future performance. There is a concentration risk of only having a few funds in the recommendation.",

To ensure that all equity schemes follow uniform definitions for defining large, mid, and small caps, the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) has defined them as follows: Large-cap companies 1st to 100th company in terms of market cap Mid-cap companies 101st to 250th company in terms of market cap Small-cap companies 251st company onwards in terms of market cap This is the basic Difference Between Large Cap, Mid Cap, And Small Cap stocks. I crunched the numbers from the latest data ( link ). The following table summarizes it: Here is a simpler explanation of the table above: The top 100 stocks, which are called largecaps, now form 64.4% of the overall marketcap of all the Indian stocks. The midcap and smallcaps have 17.8% allocation each in the overall pie. Interestingly, the minimum marketcap needed now to qualify as a largecap is Rs 67,018 Cr. The same figure for midcaps is Rs 21,994 Cr. So compared to just a few years back, many midcaps are now size of yesteryear largecaps! A while back I wrote that whether it made sense for SEBI to widen definitions to increase the number of large and mid-cap stocks? May be it is an idea worth considering now given so much money (via SIP inflows) following just a few hundred stocks.

Corporate bond funds recorded net inflows of 119.8 billion rupees ($1.40 billion) last month, more than triple of April\\'s total and the highest since March 2023, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). \"Liquidity is in surplus so there could be some flows, but investments should shift in the up to three-year segment as yields on other segments are expected to rise more,\" said Akhil Mittal, senior fixed income fund manager at Tata Asset Management.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the allocation plan (T001), a 70/30 equity/debt split is desired, reflecting a high-risk appetite. The fund shortlist (T012) presents a limited selection of funds. \n\n**Equity Allocation (70%):**\nGiven the constraints, the following funds are recommended for the equity portion:\n*   **UTI Aggressive Hybrid Fund Regular Plan-Growth (Hybrid):** This fund provides a blend of equity and debt, aligning with the aggressive risk appetite, offering a 5Y return of 19.04%.\n*   **HSBC Large Cap Fund Direct-Growth (Large Cap):** Aligns directly with the recommended 'Large Cap' category and offers a 5Y return of 18.15%.\n\n**Debt Allocation (30%):**\nThe following funds are recommended for the debt portion, considering their relatively short-term nature and returns:\n*   **Bank of India Short Term Income Fund (Debt: Short Duration):** Providing a 1Y return of 9.95% p.a. offering shorter-term stability.\n*   **Aditya Birla Sun Life US Treasury 1-3 year Bond ETFs FoF (Debt: International Debt):** Offering a 1Y return of 9.58% p.a., providing diversification by investing in US treasury bonds.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe selection prioritizes funds that align with the recommended equity and debt categories in the allocation plan. Return percentages are used as a simple comparative metric due to the lack of indicative ratings. The hybrid fund acts as an equity fund allocation given the lack of Small and Mid-Cap funds in the shortlist.\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe fund shortlist is limited, lacking a strong selection of Mid-Cap and Small-Cap equity funds. Indicative ratings are missing, and the return percentages are used as a simplified metric. Furthermore, selecting only two debt funds concentrates the debt allocation significantly. The fund return percentages are not inflation-adjusted. There is a risk due to the concentration of funds overall and the limitation of selection.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nIt is strongly recommended to retrieve data from fund-specific sources to obtain performance metrics, ratings, and expense ratios for a more thorough analysis. Expand the fund selection beyond the shortlist to include a wider range of options across all recommended categories, especially Mid-Cap and Small-Cap. Consider a tool/API that provides a larger and more varied list of Funds.\n\n**Risk Factors and Uncertainties:**\nThe recommendations are based on a limited dataset and may not reflect a comprehensive view of the available investment options. Changes in market conditions and fund performance can significantly impact the actual returns and overall portfolio performance. The historical return data is not indicative of future performance. There is a concentration risk of only having a few funds in the recommendation.",
