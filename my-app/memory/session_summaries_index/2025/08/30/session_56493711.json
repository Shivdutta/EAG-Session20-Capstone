T001 specifies an allocation of 70% equity and 30% debt, based on a 'High' risk appetite. T012 provides a list of equity and debt funds. However, it lacks AUM and performance data, which limits the ability to provide a comprehensive rating or ranking of the funds.\n\nTo confirm alignment, I cross-reference the fund categories specified in T001 ('Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', 'Small Cap' for equity and 'Short Term Debt', 'Corporate Bond' for debt) with the fund names and categories in T012. The following observations are made:\n\n*   **Equity Funds:**\n    *   Motilal Oswal Large and Midcap Fund is categorized as 'Large & MidCap Equity', aligning with the 'Large Cap' and 'Mid Cap' categories.\n    *   Invesco India Large & Mid Cap Fund is categorized as 'Large & MidCap Equity', aligning with the 'Large Cap' and 'Mid Cap' categories.\n    *   Bandhan Large & Mid Cap Fund is categorized as 'Large & MidCap Equity', aligning with the 'Large Cap' and 'Mid Cap' categories.\n*   **Debt Funds:**\n    *   PGIM India Flexi Cap Fund is categorized as 'Debt Fund', aligning with the debt allocation.\n    *   PGIM India Midcap Fund is categorized as 'Debt Fund', aligning with the debt allocation.\n    *   PGIM India Large and Mid Cap Fund is categorized as 'Debt Fund', aligning with the debt allocation.\n    *    PGIM India Large Cap Fund is categorized as 'Debt Fund', aligning with the debt allocation.\n    *   PGIM India ELSS Tax Saver Fund is categorized as 'Debt Fund', aligning with the debt allocation.\n\nGiven the lack of AUM and performance data, it is crucial to emphasize that the alignment is based purely on category matching. A more thorough evaluation requires fetching AUM and performance data using dedicated APIs, as recommended in T012.\n\n**Configuration for Downstream Math Operations:**\n\nBased on the 'High' risk appetite from T001, the following configuration is generated for downstream math operations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"annual_return_pct\": 12,\n  \"monthly_return_r\": 0.01,\n  \"inflation_pct\": 5.5,\n  \"formula_notes\": \"SIP = FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV_inflated = FV*(1+i)^years\"\n}\n```\n\nHere, the annual return percentage is set to 12% (mapping for 'High' risk appetite), and the corresponding monthly return rate is calculated. The inflation percentage is set to the default value of 5.5%. The 'formula_notes' field provides relevant formulas for SIP calculations and inflation adjustments.\n\n**Allocation Plan:**\n\nThe allocation plan remains consistent with the 70% equity and 30% debt split, as defined in T001. No changes are made to the 'allocation_plan_json' from T001, except for adding a risk disclaimer about the funds.\n\n**Risk Disclaimer:**\n\nIt is crucial to inform users that the fund shortlist is based only on fund category alignment and does not consider AUM, performance, or any other quality metrics. Further analysis is required before making any investment decisions.",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The primary task is to ensure that the fund shortlist provided in T012 aligns with the asset allocation plan defined in T001. T001 specifies an allocation of 70% equity and 30% debt, based on a 'High' risk appetite. T012 provides a list of equity and debt funds. However, it lacks AUM and performance data, which limits the ability to provide a comprehensive rating or ranking of the funds.\n\nTo confirm alignment, I cross-reference the fund categories specified in T001 ('Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', 'Small Cap' for equity and 'Short Term Debt', 'Corporate Bond' for debt) with the fund names and categories in T012. The following observations are made:\n\n*   **Equity Funds:**\n    *   Motilal Oswal Large and Midcap Fund is categorized as 'Large & MidCap Equity', aligning with the 'Large Cap' and 'Mid Cap' categories.\n    *   Invesco India Large & Mid Cap Fund is categorized as 'Large & MidCap Equity', aligning with the 'Large Cap' and 'Mid Cap' categories.\n    *   Bandhan Large & Mid Cap Fund is categorized as 'Large & MidCap Equity', aligning with the 'Large Cap' and 'Mid Cap' categories.\n*   **Debt Funds:**\n    *   PGIM India Flexi Cap Fund is categorized as 'Debt Fund', aligning with the debt allocation.\n    *   PGIM India Midcap Fund is categorized as 'Debt Fund', aligning with the debt allocation.\n    *   PGIM India Large and Mid Cap Fund is categorized as 'Debt Fund', aligning with the debt allocation.\n    *    PGIM India Large Cap Fund is categorized as 'Debt Fund', aligning with the debt allocation.\n    *   PGIM India ELSS Tax Saver Fund is categorized as 'Debt Fund', aligning with the debt allocation.\n\nGiven the lack of AUM and performance data, it is crucial to emphasize that the alignment is based purely on category matching. A more thorough evaluation requires fetching AUM and performance data using dedicated APIs, as recommended in T012.\n\n**Configuration for Downstream Math Operations:**\n\nBased on the 'High' risk appetite from T001, the following configuration is generated for downstream math operations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"annual_return_pct\": 12,\n  \"monthly_return_r\": 0.01,\n  \"inflation_pct\": 5.5,\n  \"formula_notes\": \"SIP = FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV_inflated = FV*(1+i)^years\"\n}\n```\n\nHere, the annual return percentage is set to 12% (mapping for 'High' risk appetite), and the corresponding monthly return rate is calculated. The inflation percentage is set to the default value of 5.5%. The 'formula_notes' field provides relevant formulas for SIP calculations and inflation adjustments.\n\n**Allocation Plan:**\n\nThe allocation plan remains consistent with the 70% equity and 30% debt split, as defined in T001. No changes are made to the 'allocation_plan_json' from T001, except for adding a risk disclaimer about the funds.\n\n**Risk Disclaimer:**\n\nIt is crucial to inform users that the fund shortlist is based only on fund category alignment and does not consider AUM, performance, or any other quality metrics. Further analysis is required before making any investment decisions.",
