A corresponding debt allocation isn't included based on available info.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the provided data, the user's risk appetite is 'high,' as specified in T001. This translates to a 70% equity and 30% debt allocation. The 'high' risk appetite also corresponds to an annual return percentage of 12%, as per the mapping provided in the original query. This leads to a monthly return rate of 1%. The provided fund shortlist from T012 predominantly contains 'Equity Large Cap' funds. While these funds align with the recommended 'Large Cap' equity category from T001, the portfolio lacks diversification into 'Mid Cap' and 'Small Cap' equity funds, as well as 'Short Term Debt' and 'Corporate Bond' debt funds. \n\nGiven the current fund shortlist, the initial allocation plan consists primarily of large-cap equity. To align more closely with a 'high' risk appetite and the recommended fund categories from T001, the portfolio should be expanded to include mid-cap and small-cap equity funds. This will provide a more balanced exposure to different market segments and potentially enhance returns. Furthermore, allocating 30% of the portfolio to debt funds, specifically 'Short Term Debt' and 'Corporate Bond' funds, will help mitigate risk and provide stability. \n\nThe SIP config object is created to facilitate downstream SIP calculations. It contains the annual return percentage, monthly return rate, and inflation percentage, as well as the SIP formula for future value calculation. It's essential to note that the fund categories listed in the shortlist are aligned with the allocation plan's recommended fund categories, particularly for the equity component. However, the lack of diversity within the equity category (primarily large-cap) and the absence of debt funds should be addressed to fully implement the allocation plan and align with the user's risk appetite. Future steps should incorporate a broader range of fund categories and a debt allocation component to create a more well-rounded and diversified investment portfolio. Downstream agents should use this configuration to generate accurate and informative SIP projections and reports.",

However, the fund shortlist is primarily limited to large-cap equity funds, which may warrant further diversification into mid-cap and small-cap funds. A corresponding debt allocation isn't included based on available info.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the provided data, the user's risk appetite is 'high,' as specified in T001. This translates to a 70% equity and 30% debt allocation. The 'high' risk appetite also corresponds to an annual return percentage of 12%, as per the mapping provided in the original query. This leads to a monthly return rate of 1%. The provided fund shortlist from T012 predominantly contains 'Equity Large Cap' funds. While these funds align with the recommended 'Large Cap' equity category from T001, the portfolio lacks diversification into 'Mid Cap' and 'Small Cap' equity funds, as well as 'Short Term Debt' and 'Corporate Bond' debt funds. \n\nGiven the current fund shortlist, the initial allocation plan consists primarily of large-cap equity. To align more closely with a 'high' risk appetite and the recommended fund categories from T001, the portfolio should be expanded to include mid-cap and small-cap equity funds. This will provide a more balanced exposure to different market segments and potentially enhance returns. Furthermore, allocating 30% of the portfolio to debt funds, specifically 'Short Term Debt' and 'Corporate Bond' funds, will help mitigate risk and provide stability. \n\nThe SIP config object is created to facilitate downstream SIP calculations. It contains the annual return percentage, monthly return rate, and inflation percentage, as well as the SIP formula for future value calculation. It's essential to note that the fund categories listed in the shortlist are aligned with the allocation plan's recommended fund categories, particularly for the equity component. However, the lack of diversity within the equity category (primarily large-cap) and the absence of debt funds should be addressed to fully implement the allocation plan and align with the user's risk appetite. Future steps should incorporate a broader range of fund categories and a debt allocation component to create a more well-rounded and diversified investment portfolio. Downstream agents should use this configuration to generate accurate and informative SIP projections and reports.",
