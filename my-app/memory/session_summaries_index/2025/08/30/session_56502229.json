Despite this quick growth of the industry, there still remains a striking under-penetration of mutual fund investors. Indias population stands at 144 crore, and the number of mutual fund investors stands at just 4.5 crore, about 3% of the population (United Nations Population Fund and AMFI, March 2024). One of the factors contributing to the under-penetration is the lack of investor awareness due to industry-specific jargon. Moreover, the plethora of types of mutual funds available in the market can further cause confusion in decision-making. In this blog, we will try to break down the jargon and explain different funds based on market capitalisation. To understand such funds, lets start with understanding what market capitalisation is. What is Market Capitalisation? Market capitalisation (also known as market cap) refers to the total value of a publicly traded companys outstanding shares of stock. It can be calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price per share. Market cap = Total number of outstanding shares x price per share Market capitalisation provides insight into the companys value and size. AMFI releases a list of companies based on their market capitalisation twice a year. On the basis of market capitalisation and the list released by AMFI, it is determined whether a company is large-cap, mid-cap, or small-cap. 6 Types of Mutual Funds Based on Market Capitalisation Large-cap Mutual Fund A large-cap fund is a type of equity mutual fund that has at least 80% of investment in large-cap stocks. According to SEBIs circular dated October 6, 2017, large-cap companies are the top 1st to 100th companies in terms of full market capitalisation. These companies are often well established and largely recognised, and have a track record of stable performance. Since large-cap funds invest in top-tier companies that are well-established, their stock prices tend to be less volatile than smaller companies. Moreover, large-cap funds typically deliver consistent and steady returns. However, since the risk is low and returns are stable, they tend to have lower growth potential compared to funds that invest in smaller, high-growth companies. Hence, the choice of investing in a large-cap fund depends on your financial needs, financial position, and risk profile. Mid-cap Mutual Fund A mid-cap fund is a type of equity mutual fund that has at least 65% of its investment in mid-cap stocks. According to SEBIs circular dated October 6, 2017, mid-cap companies are from 101th to 250th companies in terms of full market capitalisation. These companies are generally still in the growth phase and havent reached point of saturation such as large-cap companies. Compared to large-cap companies, mid-cap companies have a higher growth potential because they have more room to grow. This implies that as the value of a mid-cap fund's underlying securities rises, so do investors' returns. With high growth potential, comes the factor of risk. Mid-cap companies are inherently riskier as compared to large-cap companies. However, since a mid-cap fund invests in a basket of securities, the idiosyncratic risk, i.e. the company-specific risk, gets diversified. Hence, investors should carefully analyse their risk profile and financial needs before investing. Small-cap Mutual Fund A small-cap fund is a type of fund with at least 65% of its investment in small-cap companies. As per the aforementioned SEBI circular, small-cap companies are 251st company onwards in terms of full market capitalisation.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report reconciles the asset allocation plan derived from T001 with the list of available funds in T012. The user's 'high' risk appetite translates to an aggressive investment strategy, represented by a 70/30 equity/debt allocation. \n\n**SIP Configuration:**\nThe 'high' risk appetite from T001 maps to a 12% annual return. An inflation rate of 5.5% (default) is applied. The SIP formula (SIP = FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1)) will be used to calculate the required monthly investment, adjusting for inflation. The formula notes are essential for downstream calculations.\n\n**Fund Category Alignment:**\nThe recommended equity allocation can be fulfilled by several funds listed in T012, including: PGIM India Flexi Cap Fund, PGIM India Midcap Fund, PGIM India Large and Mid Cap Fund, PGIM India Large Cap Fund, PGIM India ELSS Tax Saver Fund, PGIM India Small Cap Fund, PGIM India Retirement Fund, PGIM India Multi Cap Fund, and PGIM India Healthcare Fund. These are of 'Very High' Risk. The recommendation from T001 includes Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap funds.\n\nThe debt allocation can be fulfilled by Bank of India Short Term Income Fund, Sundaram Short Duration Fund, and ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund. These funds are short term fixed income instruments. The recommendation from T001 includes Corporate Bond, Short Duration, and Gilt funds.\n\n**Allocation Considerations:**\nGiven the fund shortlist is dominated by funds from PGIM, the portfolio may lack broader diversification. Consider advising the user to research comparable funds from other fund houses in the recommended categories. The debt funds also lack ratings.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Ensure downstream math components correctly apply the extracted SIP configuration parameters.\n2. For the ReportGeneratorAgent and QAAgent, ensure all mandatory sections (Executive Summary, Goal Inputs, etc.) are present in the final report.\n3. Prioritize diversification. Recommend the user to research alternative funds to balance out the fund concentration.\n4. Highlighting the risks involved in equity funds.\n5. Check credit rating of debt funds.\n\n**Risks and Warnings:**\nThe exclusive reliance on PGIM funds poses a significant diversification risk. The 'Very High' risk factor associated with the PGIM equity funds requires caution. Market volatility could disproportionately impact this portfolio. The concentration risk is considerable as PGIM is the major fund house. Model risk from reliance on PGIM. The funds may not exist or may not be available.\n",

Despite this quick growth of the industry, there still remains a striking under-penetration of mutual fund investors. Indias population stands at 144 crore, and the number of mutual fund investors stands at just 4.5 crore, about 3% of the population (United Nations Population Fund and AMFI, March 2024). One of the factors contributing to the under-penetration is the lack of investor awareness due to industry-specific jargon. Moreover, the plethora of types of mutual funds available in the market can further cause confusion in decision-making. In this blog, we will try to break down the jargon and explain different funds based on market capitalisation. To understand such funds, lets start with understanding what market capitalisation is. What is Market Capitalisation? Market capitalisation (also known as market cap) refers to the total value of a publicly traded companys outstanding shares of stock. It can be calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price per share. Market cap = Total number of outstanding shares x price per share Market capitalisation provides insight into the companys value and size. AMFI releases a list of companies based on their market capitalisation twice a year. On the basis of market capitalisation and the list released by AMFI, it is determined whether a company is large-cap, mid-cap, or small-cap. 6 Types of Mutual Funds Based on Market Capitalisation Large-cap Mutual Fund A large-cap fund is a type of equity mutual fund that has at least 80% of investment in large-cap stocks. According to SEBIs circular dated October 6, 2017, large-cap companies are the top 1st to 100th companies in terms of full market capitalisation. These companies are often well established and largely recognised, and have a track record of stable performance. Since large-cap funds invest in top-tier companies that are well-established, their stock prices tend to be less volatile than smaller companies. Moreover, large-cap funds typically deliver consistent and steady returns. However, since the risk is low and returns are stable, they tend to have lower growth potential compared to funds that invest in smaller, high-growth companies. Hence, the choice of investing in a large-cap fund depends on your financial needs, financial position, and risk profile. Mid-cap Mutual Fund A mid-cap fund is a type of equity mutual fund that has at least 65% of its investment in mid-cap stocks. According to SEBIs circular dated October 6, 2017, mid-cap companies are from 101th to 250th companies in terms of full market capitalisation. These companies are generally still in the growth phase and havent reached point of saturation such as large-cap companies. Compared to large-cap companies, mid-cap companies have a higher growth potential because they have more room to grow. This implies that as the value of a mid-cap fund's underlying securities rises, so do investors' returns. With high growth potential, comes the factor of risk. Mid-cap companies are inherently riskier as compared to large-cap companies. However, since a mid-cap fund invests in a basket of securities, the idiosyncratic risk, i.e. the company-specific risk, gets diversified. Hence, investors should carefully analyse their risk profile and financial needs before investing.

The user's 'high' risk appetite translates to an aggressive investment strategy, represented by a 70/30 equity/debt allocation. \n\n**SIP Configuration:**\nThe 'high' risk appetite from T001 maps to a 12% annual return. An inflation rate of 5.5% (default) is applied. The SIP formula (SIP = FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1)) will be used to calculate the required monthly investment, adjusting for inflation. The formula notes are essential for downstream calculations.\n\n**Fund Category Alignment:**\nThe recommended equity allocation can be fulfilled by several funds listed in T012, including: PGIM India Flexi Cap Fund, PGIM India Midcap Fund, PGIM India Large and Mid Cap Fund, PGIM India Large Cap Fund, PGIM India ELSS Tax Saver Fund, PGIM India Small Cap Fund, PGIM India Retirement Fund, PGIM India Multi Cap Fund, and PGIM India Healthcare Fund. These are of 'Very High' Risk. The recommendation from T001 includes Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap funds.\n\nThe debt allocation can be fulfilled by Bank of India Short Term Income Fund, Sundaram Short Duration Fund, and ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund. These funds are short term fixed income instruments. The recommendation from T001 includes Corporate Bond, Short Duration, and Gilt funds.\n\n**Allocation Considerations:**\nGiven the fund shortlist is dominated by funds from PGIM, the portfolio may lack broader diversification. Consider advising the user to research comparable funds from other fund houses in the recommended categories. The debt funds also lack ratings.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Ensure downstream math components correctly apply the extracted SIP configuration parameters.\n2. For the ReportGeneratorAgent and QAAgent, ensure all mandatory sections (Executive Summary, Goal Inputs, etc.) are present in the final report.\n3. Prioritize diversification. Recommend the user to research alternative funds to balance out the fund concentration.\n4. Highlighting the risks involved in equity funds.\n5. Check credit rating of debt funds.\n\n**Risks and Warnings:**\nThe exclusive reliance on PGIM funds poses a significant diversification risk. The 'Very High' risk factor associated with the PGIM equity funds requires caution. Market volatility could disproportionately impact this portfolio. The concentration risk is considerable as PGIM is the major fund house. Model risk from reliance on PGIM. The funds may not exist or may not be available.\n",
