            "summary": "The current fund shortlist primarily contains Large Cap equity funds and doesn't fully meet the recommended asset allocation of 70% equity and 30% debt. Further fund selection is required to include Mid Cap, Small Cap (equity) and Short Term Debt, Corporate Bond (debt) funds.",
            "detailed": "The analysis reveals a discrepancy between the recommended asset allocation plan (70% equity, 30% debt) and the available fund shortlist, which consists solely of Large Cap equity funds. The allocation_plan_json, derived from T001, specifies that a 'high' risk appetite corresponds to a 70/30 equity/debt split and suggests equity categories of Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap, along with debt categories of Short Term Debt and Corporate Bond. The fund_shortlist from T012, however, only provides three Large Cap funds: Nippon India Large Cap Fund, ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund, and Invesco India Largecap Fund.\n\nTo reconcile this difference, further fund selection is necessary. The current Large Cap funds fulfill a portion of the equity allocation. However, additional funds from the Mid Cap and Small Cap categories must be included to diversify the equity portion. Furthermore, debt funds from the Short Term Debt and Corporate Bond categories are entirely absent and need to be selected to meet the 30% debt allocation. \n\nRecommendations for proceeding with fund selection include:\n\n1.  **Equity Fund Selection:**\n    *   **Mid Cap Funds:** Look for funds with consistent performance and a diversified portfolio of mid-sized companies. Consider factors like expense ratio, fund manager experience, and tracking error.\n    *   **Small Cap Funds:** Exercise caution when selecting small cap funds due to their higher volatility. Focus on funds with a proven track record and a well-defined investment strategy.\n\n2.  **Debt Fund Selection:**\n    *   **Short Term Debt Funds:** These funds are suitable for conservative investors seeking capital preservation. Look for funds with low credit risk and a short maturity profile.\n    *   **Corporate Bond Funds:** These funds offer higher yields than short-term debt funds but also carry higher credit risk. Analyze the credit quality of the underlying bonds before investing.\n\n3.  **Asset Allocation Adjustment:**\n    *   Once all fund categories are populated, periodically rebalance the portfolio to maintain the desired asset allocation. This involves selling assets that have outperformed and buying assets that have underperformed.\n\n4. **Risk assessment:**\n*  **Market Risk:** Equity investments are subject to market fluctuations and economic downturns. Diversifying across different equity categories (Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap) can mitigate this risk.\n*   **Credit Risk:** Corporate bond funds carry the risk that the issuer may default on its debt obligations. Thoroughly assess the creditworthiness of the issuers before investing.\n\nGiven the current information, the selection is incomplete. A more comprehensive selection is required to fulfill the proposed allocation plan.\n",

Further fund selection is required to include Mid Cap, Small Cap (equity) and Short Term Debt, Corporate Bond (debt) funds.",
            "detailed": "The analysis reveals a discrepancy between the recommended asset allocation plan (70% equity, 30% debt) and the available fund shortlist, which consists solely of Large Cap equity funds. The allocation_plan_json, derived from T001, specifies that a 'high' risk appetite corresponds to a 70/30 equity/debt split and suggests equity categories of Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap, along with debt categories of Short Term Debt and Corporate Bond. The fund_shortlist from T012, however, only provides three Large Cap funds: Nippon India Large Cap Fund, ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund, and Invesco India Largecap Fund.\n\nTo reconcile this difference, further fund selection is necessary. The current Large Cap funds fulfill a portion of the equity allocation. However, additional funds from the Mid Cap and Small Cap categories must be included to diversify the equity portion. Furthermore, debt funds from the Short Term Debt and Corporate Bond categories are entirely absent and need to be selected to meet the 30% debt allocation. \n\nRecommendations for proceeding with fund selection include:\n\n1.  **Equity Fund Selection:**\n    *   **Mid Cap Funds:** Look for funds with consistent performance and a diversified portfolio of mid-sized companies. Consider factors like expense ratio, fund manager experience, and tracking error.\n    *   **Small Cap Funds:** Exercise caution when selecting small cap funds due to their higher volatility. Focus on funds with a proven track record and a well-defined investment strategy.\n\n2.  **Debt Fund Selection:**\n    *   **Short Term Debt Funds:** These funds are suitable for conservative investors seeking capital preservation. Look for funds with low credit risk and a short maturity profile.\n    *   **Corporate Bond Funds:** These funds offer higher yields than short-term debt funds but also carry higher credit risk. Analyze the credit quality of the underlying bonds before investing.\n\n3.  **Asset Allocation Adjustment:**\n    *   Once all fund categories are populated, periodically rebalance the portfolio to maintain the desired asset allocation. This involves selling assets that have outperformed and buying assets that have underperformed.\n\n4. **Risk assessment:**\n*  **Market Risk:** Equity investments are subject to market fluctuations and economic downturns. Diversifying across different equity categories (Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap) can mitigate this risk.\n*   **Credit Risk:** Corporate bond funds carry the risk that the issuer may default on its debt obligations. Thoroughly assess the creditworthiness of the issuers before investing.\n\nGiven the current information, the selection is incomplete. A more comprehensive selection is required to fulfill the proposed allocation plan.\n",
