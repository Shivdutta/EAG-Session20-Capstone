To ensure that all equity schemes follow uniform definitions for defining large, mid, and small caps, the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) has defined them as follows: Large-cap companies 1st to 100th company in terms of market cap Mid-cap companies 101st to 250th company in terms of market cap Small-cap companies 251st company onwards in terms of market cap This is the basic Difference Between Large Cap, Mid Cap, And Small Cap stocks. I crunched the numbers from the latest data ( link ). The following table summarizes it: Here is a simpler explanation of the table above: The top 100 stocks, which are called largecaps, now form 64.4% of the overall marketcap of all the Indian stocks. The midcap and smallcaps have 17.8% allocation each in the overall pie. Interestingly, the minimum marketcap needed now to qualify as a largecap is Rs 67,018 Cr. The same figure for midcaps is Rs 21,994 Cr. So compared to just a few years back, many midcaps are now size of yesteryear largecaps! A while back I wrote that whether it made sense for SEBI to widen definitions to increase the number of large and mid-cap stocks? May be it is an idea worth considering now given so much money (via SIP inflows) following just a few hundred stocks.

Find out which mutual fund category truly outperformed. Written by PF Desk August 27, 2025 06:22 IST Follow Us Large-cap vs mid-cap vs small-cap mutual funds: Which category gave the best 10-year returns? (Image: AI generated) The last 10 years have been very important for mutual fund investors. During this period, the stock market has experienced ups and downs, as well as boom times; however, those who remained invested in the long term were rewarded. Those who invested in the three key categories of equity funds large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap experienced different levels of returns and risk. Data shows that in 10 years, small-cap funds performed the best. Mid-cap funds also did not lag. On the other hand, large-cap funds gave a relatively low return, yet stable performance. This clearly means that whoever took more risk also got higher returns in the long term.

Mid-cap funds Mid caps also did not disappoint investors and gave an average return of 16.27%. Large-cap funds The average performance of this category was 12.79%, which is less than small and mid cap, but is considered important from the stability point of view. Although the category average gives an overall picture, if we look at the top funds in these three categories, the returns are much higher. Small-cap category The top 5 funds (direct plan) of this category have given more than 20% returns in 10 years.

Risk is relatively low, but returns are also limited compared to other categories.

The allocation plan specifies a 70% equity and 30% debt allocation, suitable for a 'high' risk appetite.  It also recommends fund categories: Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap for equity, and Short Term Debt, Corporate Bond for debt.\n\nBased on the fund shortlist, the following funds are recommended:\n\n**Equity (70% Allocation):**\n\n*   **Large Cap:** PGIM India Large Cap Fund\n*   **Mid Cap:** PGIM India Midcap Fund\n*   **Small Cap:** PGIM India Small Cap Fund\n\nThese funds align with the recommended 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', and 'Small Cap' equity categories, providing diversification within the equity portion of the portfolio. The percentage split across Large, Mid and Small cap is not specified and will need to be chosen based on further risk analysis.\n\nIf ELSS investment option is preferred,  PGIM India ELSS Tax Saver Fund may be suitable.\n\n**Debt (30% Allocation):**\n\n*   **Short Term Debt:** Bank of India Short Term Income Fund, Sundaram Short Duration Fund, ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund, HDFC Short Term Debt Fund, Aditya Birla SL Short Term Fund, Bandhan Bond Fund - Short Term Plan-Reg, Kotak Bond Short Term Fund, SBI Short Term Debt Fund-Reg, Axis Short Duration Fund-Reg\n\nThese funds are classified as 'Short Term Debt' funds. The choice of a particular Short Term Debt fund can be based on factors such as expense ratio, credit quality, and historical performance.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe selection process prioritized matching the funds from the shortlist to the categories outlined in the allocation plan. This ensures alignment with the overall investment strategy and the investor's risk appetite. The 70/30 equity/debt split is maintained by allocating the appropriate percentage to each asset class.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis is a fund category recommendation and not financial advice.

To ensure that all equity schemes follow uniform definitions for defining large, mid, and small caps, the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) has defined them as follows: Large-cap companies 1st to 100th company in terms of market cap Mid-cap companies 101st to 250th company in terms of market cap Small-cap companies 251st company onwards in terms of market cap This is the basic Difference Between Large Cap, Mid Cap, And Small Cap stocks. I crunched the numbers from the latest data ( link ). The following table summarizes it: Here is a simpler explanation of the table above: The top 100 stocks, which are called largecaps, now form 64.4% of the overall marketcap of all the Indian stocks. The midcap and smallcaps have 17.8% allocation each in the overall pie. Interestingly, the minimum marketcap needed now to qualify as a largecap is Rs 67,018 Cr. The same figure for midcaps is Rs 21,994 Cr. So compared to just a few years back, many midcaps are now size of yesteryear largecaps! A while back I wrote that whether it made sense for SEBI to widen definitions to increase the number of large and mid-cap stocks? May be it is an idea worth considering now given so much money (via SIP inflows) following just a few hundred stocks.

Find out which mutual fund category truly outperformed. Written by PF Desk August 27, 2025 06:22 IST Follow Us Large-cap vs mid-cap vs small-cap mutual funds: Which category gave the best 10-year returns? (Image: AI generated) The last 10 years have been very important for mutual fund investors. During this period, the stock market has experienced ups and downs, as well as boom times; however, those who remained invested in the long term were rewarded. Those who invested in the three key categories of equity funds large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap experienced different levels of returns and risk. Data shows that in 10 years, small-cap funds performed the best. Mid-cap funds also did not lag. On the other hand, large-cap funds gave a relatively low return, yet stable performance. This clearly means that whoever took more risk also got higher returns in the long term.

Mid-cap funds Mid caps also did not disappoint investors and gave an average return of 16.27%. Large-cap funds The average performance of this category was 12.79%, which is less than small and mid cap, but is considered important from the stability point of view. Although the category average gives an overall picture, if we look at the top funds in these three categories, the returns are much higher.

The allocation plan specifies a 70% equity and 30% debt allocation, suitable for a 'high' risk appetite.  It also recommends fund categories: Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap for equity, and Short Term Debt, Corporate Bond for debt.\n\nBased on the fund shortlist, the following funds are recommended:\n\n**Equity (70% Allocation):**\n\n*   **Large Cap:** PGIM India Large Cap Fund\n*   **Mid Cap:** PGIM India Midcap Fund\n*   **Small Cap:** PGIM India Small Cap Fund\n\nThese funds align with the recommended 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', and 'Small Cap' equity categories, providing diversification within the equity portion of the portfolio. The percentage split across Large, Mid and Small cap is not specified and will need to be chosen based on further risk analysis.\n\nIf ELSS investment option is preferred,  PGIM India ELSS Tax Saver Fund may be suitable.\n\n**Debt (30% Allocation):**\n\n*   **Short Term Debt:** Bank of India Short Term Income Fund, Sundaram Short Duration Fund, ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund, HDFC Short Term Debt Fund, Aditya Birla SL Short Term Fund, Bandhan Bond Fund - Short Term Plan-Reg, Kotak Bond Short Term Fund, SBI Short Term Debt Fund-Reg, Axis Short Duration Fund-Reg\n\nThese funds are classified as 'Short Term Debt' funds. The choice of a particular Short Term Debt fund can be based on factors such as expense ratio, credit quality, and historical performance.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe selection process prioritized matching the funds from the shortlist to the categories outlined in the allocation plan. This ensures alignment with the overall investment strategy and the investor's risk appetite. The 70/30 equity/debt split is maintained by allocating the appropriate percentage to each asset class.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis is a fund category recommendation and not financial advice.
