Given that the fund shortlist (T012) exclusively contains 'Equity | Growth' funds from PGIM India, the preliminary allocation plan focuses solely on the equity component. This initial allocation necessitates refinement once T001 obtains user-defined goal and risk parameters. The allocation plan is a preliminary one due to the data constraints. The next step would be to refine this by incorporating debt funds and fine-tuning the percentages of equity vs. debt based on the user's actual risk tolerance.",

However, T001 is awaiting goal details and does not provide any allocation information. Therefore, a 'Moderate' risk profile is assumed, leading to a 50/50 equity/debt allocation strategy. Given that the fund shortlist (T012) exclusively contains 'Equity | Growth' funds from PGIM India, the preliminary allocation plan focuses solely on the equity component. This initial allocation necessitates refinement once T001 obtains user-defined goal and risk parameters. The allocation plan is a preliminary one due to the data constraints. The next step would be to refine this by incorporating debt funds and fine-tuning the percentages of equity vs. debt based on the user's actual risk tolerance.",
