The asset allocation plan dictates a 70% equity and 30% debt allocation based on a high risk appetite. The fund shortlist currently contains only equity funds from the 'Large & Mid Cap Equity Mutual Fund' category, specifically 'Motilal Oswal Large and Midcap Fund', 'Invesco India Large & Mid Cap Fund', and 'Bandhan Large & Mid Cap Fund'. The T012 output notes that debt fund data was unavailable, representing a significant gap in fulfilling the complete allocation strategy.\n\nTo achieve the 70/30 equity/debt allocation, it is imperative to identify and select suitable debt funds. The recommended debt fund categories are 'Short Term Debt', 'Corporate Bond', and 'Gilt', as outlined in T001.allocation_plan_json. The selection process should involve researching and evaluating funds within these categories based on factors such as credit rating, expense ratio, and historical performance.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Debt Fund Selection:** Prioritize the selection of debt funds within the recommended categories to achieve the target 30% allocation.\n2.  **Fund Category Alignment:** Ensure that selected equity funds align with the 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', and 'Small Cap' equity categories recommended in T001.allocation\\_plan\\_json to maintain a diversified equity portfolio.\n3.  **Data Completeness:** Address the data extraction issues in T012 to ensure comprehensive data collection for both equity and debt funds in future iterations.\n4.  **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate the risk-return profile of potential debt funds to ensure alignment with the investor's risk appetite and overall portfolio objectives.\n\n**Allocation Plan with Current Funds:**\n\nGiven the current limitations, the allocation plan can be represented as:\n\n*   Equity (70%):\n    *   'Large & Mid Cap Equity Mutual Fund':\n        *   Motilal Oswal Large and Midcap Fund\n        *   Invesco India Large & Mid Cap Fund\n        *   Bandhan Large & Mid Cap Fund\n*   Debt (30%): To be determined. Recommended fund categories: Short Term Debt, Corporate Bond, and Gilt.\n\n**Risks and Warnings:**\n\n*   The current portfolio is heavily weighted towards equity, which may not be suitable for all investors, particularly during periods of market volatility.\n*   The absence of debt funds exposes the portfolio to increased risk and may not provide the necessary downside protection.\n*   The performance of the current equity funds may not be representative of the broader equity market due to their specific focus on large and mid-cap stocks.\n\n**Key Factors Considered:**\n\n*   Risk Appetite: High (as defined in the original query and T001).\n*   Target Asset Allocation: 70% Equity / 30% Debt.\n*   Fund Category Recommendations: Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap (Equity); Short Term Debt, Corporate Bond, Gilt (Debt).\n*   Data Availability: Limited to equity funds in the current fund shortlist.",

The asset allocation plan dictates a 70% equity and 30% debt allocation based on a high risk appetite. The fund shortlist currently contains only equity funds from the 'Large & Mid Cap Equity Mutual Fund' category, specifically 'Motilal Oswal Large and Midcap Fund', 'Invesco India Large & Mid Cap Fund', and 'Bandhan Large & Mid Cap Fund'. The T012 output notes that debt fund data was unavailable, representing a significant gap in fulfilling the complete allocation strategy.\n\nTo achieve the 70/30 equity/debt allocation, it is imperative to identify and select suitable debt funds. The recommended debt fund categories are 'Short Term Debt', 'Corporate Bond', and 'Gilt', as outlined in T001.allocation_plan_json. The selection process should involve researching and evaluating funds within these categories based on factors such as credit rating, expense ratio, and historical performance.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Debt Fund Selection:** Prioritize the selection of debt funds within the recommended categories to achieve the target 30% allocation.\n2.  **Fund Category Alignment:** Ensure that selected equity funds align with the 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', and 'Small Cap' equity categories recommended in T001.allocation\\_plan\\_json to maintain a diversified equity portfolio.\n3.  **Data Completeness:** Address the data extraction issues in T012 to ensure comprehensive data collection for both equity and debt funds in future iterations.\n4.  **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate the risk-return profile of potential debt funds to ensure alignment with the investor's risk appetite and overall portfolio objectives.\n\n**Allocation Plan with Current Funds:**\n\nGiven the current limitations, the allocation plan can be represented as:\n\n*   Equity (70%):\n    *   'Large & Mid Cap Equity Mutual Fund':\n        *   Motilal Oswal Large and Midcap Fund\n        *   Invesco India Large & Mid Cap Fund\n        *   Bandhan Large & Mid Cap Fund\n*   Debt (30%): To be determined. Recommended fund categories: Short Term Debt, Corporate Bond, and Gilt.\n\n**Risks and Warnings:**\n\n*   The current portfolio is heavily weighted towards equity, which may not be suitable for all investors, particularly during periods of market volatility.\n*   The absence of debt funds exposes the portfolio to increased risk and may not provide the necessary downside protection.\n*   The performance of the current equity funds may not be representative of the broader equity market due to their specific focus on large and mid-cap stocks.\n\n**Key Factors Considered:**\n\n*   Risk Appetite: High (as defined in the original query and T001).\n*   Target Asset Allocation: 70% Equity / 30% Debt.\n*   Fund Category Recommendations: Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap (Equity); Short Term Debt, Corporate Bond, Gilt (Debt).\n*   Data Availability: Limited to equity funds in the current fund shortlist.",
