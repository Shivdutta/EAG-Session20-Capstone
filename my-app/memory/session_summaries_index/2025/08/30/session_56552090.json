            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The fund shortlist from T012 was reviewed to identify funds aligning with the allocation strategy defined in T001. Given the 'high' risk appetite (70% equity, 30% debt), the following funds were selected:\n\n**Equity (70%):**\n\n*   **Large Cap:** Nippon India Large Cap Fund (Return (p.a): 24.45 %) - Aligns with the Large Cap category and exhibits strong returns. ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund (Return (p.a): 21.81 %) and Invesco India Largecap Fund (Return (p.a): 20.32 %) are also good options.\n*   **Mid Cap:** Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund (Return (p.a): 34.56 %) - A high-performing fund that fits the Mid Cap category. Invesco India Mid Cap Fund (Return (p.a): 29.46 %) and Edelweiss Mid Cap Fund (Return (p.a): 30.94 %) are also considered.\n*   **Small Cap:** Invesco India Smallcap Fund (1Y Returns: -0.2%) is the least bad and aligns to the Small Cap Mutual Fund category. Bandhan and Nippon have negative returns so it is being skipped.\n\nRationale: These equity funds provide a mix of market capitalizations to achieve the desired equity exposure. The funds were chosen for their positive returns, aligning with the high-risk, high-reward profile of the allocation.\n\n**Debt (30%):**\n\n*   **Corporate Bond Funds:** Nippon India Corporate Bond Fund (Return (p.a): 7.07%) - Offers a stable return and aligns with the Corporate Bond Funds category. Axis Corporate Bond Fund (Return (p.a): 6.91%) and ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund (Return (p.a): 6.83%) are also viable.\n*   **Short Duration Funds:** Bank of India Short Term Income Fund (Return (p.a): 10.69%) - Delivers a higher return compared to other short-duration funds and matches the Short Duration Funds category. Sundaram Short Duration Fund (Return (p.a): 7.79%) is also a potential choice.\n\nRationale: The debt funds were selected for their relatively stable returns, providing a counterbalance to the higher-risk equity allocation. The selection prioritizes positive and competitive yields in the respective categories.\n\n**SIP Configuration:**\n\nBased on the 'high' risk appetite and the allocation plan, the following SIP configuration is determined:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"annual_return_pct\": 12,\n  \"monthly_return_r\": 0.01,\n  \"inflation_pct\": 5.5,\n  \"formula_notes\": \"SIP = FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV_inflated = FV*(1+i)^years\"\n}\n```\n\n*   `annual_return_pct`: 12 - Corresponds to the 'high' risk appetite (as defined in the SIP context).\n*   `monthly_return_r`: 0.01 - Calculated as `annual_return_pct / 12 / 100` (12% / 12 / 100 = 0.01).\n*   `inflation_pct`: 5.5 - Default inflation rate (from the SIP context).\n*   `formula_notes`: Explanation of the SIP and inflation calculation formulas.\n\n**Allocation Policy:**\n\nThe allocation policy is determined by the 'high' risk appetite, mapping to an 70/30 equity/debt allocation.\n\n**Allocation Plan JSON:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"equity_percent\": 70,\n  \"debt_percent\": 30,\n  \"recommended_fund_categories\": {\n    \"equity\": [\n      \"Large Cap\",\n      \"Mid Cap\",\n      \"Small Cap\"\n    ],\n    \"debt\": [\n      \"Corporate Bond Funds\",\n      \"Short Duration Funds\"\n    ],\n    \"elss_optional\": true\n  },\n  \"notes\": {\n    \"very_low\": \"Very Low policy → Extremely conservative, e.g., 90% debt / 10% equity\",\n    \"low\": \"Low policy → Conservative, e.g., 70% debt / 30% equity\",\n    \"low_moderate\": \"Low-Moderate policy → Tilted conservative, e.g., 60% debt / 40% equity\",\n    \"moderate\": \"Moderate policy → Balanced mix, e.g., 50% equity / 50% debt\",\n    \"high_moderate\": \"High-Moderate policy → Tilted aggressive, e.g., 60% equity / 40% equity\",\n    \"high\": \"High policy → Aggressive, e.g., 70% equity / 30% debt\",\n    \"very_high\": \"Very High policy → Extremely aggressive, e.g., 90% equity / 10% debt\"\n  }\n}\n```",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The fund shortlist from T012 was reviewed to identify funds aligning with the allocation strategy defined in T001. Given the 'high' risk appetite (70% equity, 30% debt), the following funds were selected:\n\n**Equity (70%):**\n\n*   **Large Cap:** Nippon India Large Cap Fund (Return (p.a): 24.45 %) - Aligns with the Large Cap category and exhibits strong returns. ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund (Return (p.a): 21.81 %) and Invesco India Largecap Fund (Return (p.a): 20.32 %) are also good options.\n*   **Mid Cap:** Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund (Return (p.a): 34.56 %) - A high-performing fund that fits the Mid Cap category. Invesco India Mid Cap Fund (Return (p.a): 29.46 %) and Edelweiss Mid Cap Fund (Return (p.a): 30.94 %) are also considered.\n*   **Small Cap:** Invesco India Smallcap Fund (1Y Returns: -0.2%) is the least bad and aligns to the Small Cap Mutual Fund category. Bandhan and Nippon have negative returns so it is being skipped.\n\nRationale: These equity funds provide a mix of market capitalizations to achieve the desired equity exposure. The funds were chosen for their positive returns, aligning with the high-risk, high-reward profile of the allocation.\n\n**Debt (30%):**\n\n*   **Corporate Bond Funds:** Nippon India Corporate Bond Fund (Return (p.a): 7.07%) - Offers a stable return and aligns with the Corporate Bond Funds category. Axis Corporate Bond Fund (Return (p.a): 6.91%) and ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund (Return (p.a): 6.83%) are also viable.\n*   **Short Duration Funds:** Bank of India Short Term Income Fund (Return (p.a): 10.69%) - Delivers a higher return compared to other short-duration funds and matches the Short Duration Funds category. Sundaram Short Duration Fund (Return (p.a): 7.79%) is also a potential choice.\n\nRationale: The debt funds were selected for their relatively stable returns, providing a counterbalance to the higher-risk equity allocation. The selection prioritizes positive and competitive yields in the respective categories.\n\n**SIP Configuration:**\n\nBased on the 'high' risk appetite and the allocation plan, the following SIP configuration is determined:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"annual_return_pct\": 12,\n  \"monthly_return_r\": 0.01,\n  \"inflation_pct\": 5.5,\n  \"formula_notes\": \"SIP = FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV_inflated = FV*(1+i)^years\"\n}\n```\n\n*   `annual_return_pct`: 12 - Corresponds to the 'high' risk appetite (as defined in the SIP context).\n*   `monthly_return_r`: 0.01 - Calculated as `annual_return_pct / 12 / 100` (12% / 12 / 100 = 0.01).\n*   `inflation_pct`: 5.5 - Default inflation rate (from the SIP context).\n*   `formula_notes`: Explanation of the SIP and inflation calculation formulas.\n\n**Allocation Policy:**\n\nThe allocation policy is determined by the 'high' risk appetite, mapping to an 70/30 equity/debt allocation.\n\n**Allocation Plan JSON:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"equity_percent\": 70,\n  \"debt_percent\": 30,\n  \"recommended_fund_categories\": {\n    \"equity\": [\n      \"Large Cap\",\n      \"Mid Cap\",\n      \"Small Cap\"\n    ],\n    \"debt\": [\n      \"Corporate Bond Funds\",\n      \"Short Duration Funds\"\n    ],\n    \"elss_optional\": true\n  },\n  \"notes\": {\n    \"very_low\": \"Very Low policy → Extremely conservative, e.g., 90% debt / 10% equity\",\n    \"low\": \"Low policy → Conservative, e.g., 70% debt / 30% equity\",\n    \"low_moderate\": \"Low-Moderate policy → Tilted conservative, e.g., 60% debt / 40% equity\",\n    \"moderate\": \"Moderate policy → Balanced mix, e.g., 50% equity / 50% debt\",\n    \"high_moderate\": \"High-Moderate policy → Tilted aggressive, e.g., 60% equity / 40% equity\",\n    \"high\": \"High policy → Aggressive, e.g., 70% equity / 30% debt\",\n    \"very_high\": \"Very High policy → Extremely aggressive, e.g., 90% equity / 10% debt\"\n  }\n}\n```",
