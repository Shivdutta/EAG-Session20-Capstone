Find out which mutual fund category truly outperformed. Written by PF Desk August 27, 2025 06:22 IST Follow Us Large-cap vs mid-cap vs small-cap mutual funds: Which category gave the best 10-year returns? (Image: AI generated) The last 10 years have been very important for mutual fund investors. During this period, the stock market has experienced ups and downs, as well as boom times; however, those who remained invested in the long term were rewarded. Those who invested in the three key categories of equity funds large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap experienced different levels of returns and risk. Data shows that in 10 years, small-cap funds performed the best. Mid-cap funds also did not lag. On the other hand, large-cap funds gave a relatively low return, yet stable performance. This clearly means that whoever took more risk also got higher returns in the long term. ALSO READ 5 mutual funds with biggest rebounds since Covid-19 crash Top fund turned Rs 1 lakh into Rs 9.5 lakh Small-cap Vs mid-cap Vs large-cap Category average returns Small-cap funds This category has given an average return of 17.35% in the last 10 years. Mid-cap funds Mid caps also did not disappoint investors and gave an average return of 16.27%. Large-cap funds The average performance of this category was 12.79%, which is less than small and mid cap, but is considered important from the stability point of view. Although the category average gives an overall picture, if we look at the top funds in these three categories, the returns are much higher. Small-cap category The top 5 funds (direct plan) of this category have given more than 20% returns in 10 years. Nippon India Small Cap Fund (22.67%) Axis Small Cap Fund (20.43%) Quant Small Cap Fund (20.34%) SBI Small Cap Fund (20.33%) HDFC Small Cap Fund (20.17%) Mid-cap category Top 5 mid cap-funds (direct plans) have given around 19% to 20% returns in 10 years. Invesco India Mid Cap Fund (20.33%) Kotak Midcap Fund (19.82%) Edelweiss Mid Cap Fund (19.60%) Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund (19.29%) Nippon India Growth Mid Cap Fund (18.98%) Large-cap category Large-cap funds (direct plans) also performed well and top 5 funds gave returns of 15% to 16%. Quant Focused Fund (16.03%) Nippon India Large Cap Fund (15.68%) ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund (15.60%) Canara Robeco Large Cap Fund (15.52%) Invesco India Largecap Fund (14.90%) (Data source: Value Research) ALSO READ What is Mutual Fund overlap and how does it impact your portfolio? Benefits and risks Small-cap funds Big opportunity for high returns, but also the highest risk. These are most affected during market downturns. Mid-cap funds Balanced category, in which growth prospects are also good and risk is less than small cap. Large-cap funds Considered stable and safe investment options. Risk is relatively low, but returns are also limited compared to other categories. Caution for investors Investors should note that these figures reflect the average and top fund performance over the last 10 years.

To ensure that all equity schemes follow uniform definitions for defining large, mid, and small caps, the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) has defined them as follows: Large-cap companies 1st to 100th company in terms of market cap Mid-cap companies 101st to 250th company in terms of market cap Small-cap companies 251st company onwards in terms of market cap This is the basic Difference Between Large Cap, Mid Cap, And Small Cap stocks. I crunched the numbers from the latest data ( link ). The following table summarizes it: Here is a simpler explanation of the table above: The top 100 stocks, which are called largecaps, now form 64.4% of the overall marketcap of all the Indian stocks. The midcap and smallcaps have 17.8% allocation each in the overall pie. Interestingly, the minimum marketcap needed now to qualify as a largecap is Rs 67,018 Cr. The same figure for midcaps is Rs 21,994 Cr. So compared to just a few years back, many midcaps are now size of yesteryear largecaps! A while back I wrote that whether it made sense for SEBI to widen definitions to increase the number of large and mid-cap stocks? May be it is an idea worth considering now given so much money (via SIP inflows) following just a few hundred stocks.

Corporate bond funds recorded net inflows of 119.8 billion rupees ($1.40 billion) last month, more than triple of April\\'s total and the highest since March 2023, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). \"Liquidity is in surplus so there could be some flows, but investments should shift in the up to three-year segment as yields on other segments are expected to rise more,\" said Akhil Mittal, senior fixed income fund manager at Tata Asset Management.

            "detailed": "The fund shortlist provided in T012 outlines 'Equity Funds' and 'Debt Funds' as the investment categories. The allocation_plan_json from T001 recommends a 70% allocation to equity and a 30% allocation to debt, consistent with a 'high' risk appetite. Specifically, T001 delineates further into sub-categories within equity as 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', and 'Small Cap', while debt is segregated into 'Short Term Debt', 'Corporate Bond', and 'Gilt'.\n\nThe categories listed in T012 are broad and match those defined in T001 at a high-level. However, T012 lacks specific fund names and deeper sub-categorizations within equity and debt segments. To ensure complete alignment, further fund selection should prioritize options falling under the sub-categories as defined in T001, like prioritizing Large Cap Equity Funds or Corporate Bond Debt Funds, etc.\n\nThe SIP configuration parameters have been set in accordance with the 'high' risk appetite specified in T001. This maps to an annual return percentage of 12%, leading to a monthly return rate (monthly_return_r) of 0.01 (1%). The default inflation percentage is set at 5.5% annually.\n\nThe alignment between the high-level categories from T012 and the categories specified in T001's allocation_plan_json confirms the overall asset allocation strategy remains consistent. The reconciliation ensures that investments are made in categories that match the specified allocation percentages. The generated config object includes the SIP configuration parameters necessary for downstream calculations. However, end-users need to select specific funds within those broader categories that also fit the more granular recommendations found within T001.\n\nPotential discrepancies may arise from the absence of specific fund details in T012 and are limited to the fund category level. To mitigate risks, it is recommended to conduct detailed research to identify the most suitable funds under each category and sub-category, ensuring investments are made based on risk adjusted factors.",

Written by PF Desk August 27, 2025 06:22 IST Follow Us Large-cap vs mid-cap vs small-cap mutual funds: Which category gave the best 10-year returns? (Image: AI generated) The last 10 years have been very important for mutual fund investors. During this period, the stock market has experienced ups and downs, as well as boom times; however, those who remained invested in the long term were rewarded. Those who invested in the three key categories of equity funds large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap experienced different levels of returns and risk. Data shows that in 10 years, small-cap funds performed the best. Mid-cap funds also did not lag. On the other hand, large-cap funds gave a relatively low return, yet stable performance. This clearly means that whoever took more risk also got higher returns in the long term.

To ensure that all equity schemes follow uniform definitions for defining large, mid, and small caps, the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) has defined them as follows: Large-cap companies 1st to 100th company in terms of market cap Mid-cap companies 101st to 250th company in terms of market cap Small-cap companies 251st company onwards in terms of market cap This is the basic Difference Between Large Cap, Mid Cap, And Small Cap stocks. I crunched the numbers from the latest data ( link ). The following table summarizes it: Here is a simpler explanation of the table above: The top 100 stocks, which are called largecaps, now form 64.4% of the overall marketcap of all the Indian stocks. The midcap and smallcaps have 17.8% allocation each in the overall pie. Interestingly, the minimum marketcap needed now to qualify as a largecap is Rs 67,018 Cr. The same figure for midcaps is Rs 21,994 Cr. So compared to just a few years back, many midcaps are now size of yesteryear largecaps! A while back I wrote that whether it made sense for SEBI to widen definitions to increase the number of large and mid-cap stocks? May be it is an idea worth considering now given so much money (via SIP inflows) following just a few hundred stocks.

Corporate bond funds recorded net inflows of 119.8 billion rupees ($1.40 billion) last month, more than triple of April\\'s total and the highest since March 2023, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). \"Liquidity is in surplus so there could be some flows, but investments should shift in the up to three-year segment as yields on other segments are expected to rise more,\" said Akhil Mittal, senior fixed income fund manager at Tata Asset Management.

The allocation_plan_json from T001 recommends a 70% allocation to equity and a 30% allocation to debt, consistent with a 'high' risk appetite. Specifically, T001 delineates further into sub-categories within equity as 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', and 'Small Cap', while debt is segregated into 'Short Term Debt', 'Corporate Bond', and 'Gilt'.\n\nThe categories listed in T012 are broad and match those defined in T001 at a high-level. However, T012 lacks specific fund names and deeper sub-categorizations within equity and debt segments. To ensure complete alignment, further fund selection should prioritize options falling under the sub-categories as defined in T001, like prioritizing Large Cap Equity Funds or Corporate Bond Debt Funds, etc.\n\nThe SIP configuration parameters have been set in accordance with the 'high' risk appetite specified in T001. This maps to an annual return percentage of 12%, leading to a monthly return rate (monthly_return_r) of 0.01 (1%). The default inflation percentage is set at 5.5% annually.\n\nThe alignment between the high-level categories from T012 and the categories specified in T001's allocation_plan_json confirms the overall asset allocation strategy remains consistent. The reconciliation ensures that investments are made in categories that match the specified allocation percentages. The generated config object includes the SIP configuration parameters necessary for downstream calculations. However, end-users need to select specific funds within those broader categories that also fit the more granular recommendations found within T001.\n\nPotential discrepancies may arise from the absence of specific fund details in T012 and are limited to the fund category level. To mitigate risks, it is recommended to conduct detailed research to identify the most suitable funds under each category and sub-category, ensuring investments are made based on risk adjusted factors.",
