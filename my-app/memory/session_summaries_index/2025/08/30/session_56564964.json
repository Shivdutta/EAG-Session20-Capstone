            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The goal is to align the fund shortlist from T012 with the asset allocation plan from T001, given a 'High' risk appetite. The 'High' risk appetite translates to a 70% equity and 30% debt allocation. The recommended fund categories from T001 are Equity (Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap) and Debt (Short Term Debt, Corporate Bond). From the fund shortlist (T012), the following funds are chosen to match the allocation strategy:\n\n**Equity (70%):**\n*   Invesco India Largecap Fund (equity_large_cap): Aligns with the Large Cap category.\n*   Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund (equity_mid_cap): Aligns with the Mid Cap category.\n*   Invesco India Smallcap Fund (equity_small_cap): Aligns with the Small Cap category.\n\n**Debt (30%):**\n*   Invesco India Short Duration Fund (debt_short_term): Aligns with the Short Term Debt category.\n*   Invesco India Corporate Bond Fund (debt_corporate_bond): Aligns with the Corporate Bond category.\n\nSince no weighting of equity funds is prescribed, the available MidCap fund is of a significant size with a good return. While data extraction was limited and indicative ratings are missing, the fund categories are adequately represented. This initial allocation assumes an equal distribution within equity and debt components (e.g., equal allocation to Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap, and to Short Term Debt and Corporate Bond). Further refinement may be needed based on fund-specific metrics such as expense ratio, AUM, and risk-adjusted returns, once available from dedicated financial data APIs. The allocation_plan_json object reflects this fund alignment and adheres to the risk-return policy.\n\n**Caveats and Risks:**\n\nThe lack of comprehensive fund ratings and performance data presents a significant risk. Relying solely on fund categories without detailed analysis can lead to suboptimal investment choices. Further analysis of each fund's expense ratio, tracking error, fund manager tenure, and risk-adjusted returns is crucial before making any final allocation decisions. The current allocation assumes a consistent risk profile for all funds within a category, which may not be accurate. Market fluctuations and fund-specific events can also significantly impact the performance of these funds. This initial allocation should be considered a starting point, subject to continuous monitoring and adjustments based on market conditions and fund performance. Without a deeper dive and due diligence this investment strategy is risky.\n",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The goal is to align the fund shortlist from T012 with the asset allocation plan from T001, given a 'High' risk appetite. The 'High' risk appetite translates to a 70% equity and 30% debt allocation. The recommended fund categories from T001 are Equity (Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap) and Debt (Short Term Debt, Corporate Bond). From the fund shortlist (T012), the following funds are chosen to match the allocation strategy:\n\n**Equity (70%):**\n*   Invesco India Largecap Fund (equity_large_cap): Aligns with the Large Cap category.\n*   Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund (equity_mid_cap): Aligns with the Mid Cap category.\n*   Invesco India Smallcap Fund (equity_small_cap): Aligns with the Small Cap category.\n\n**Debt (30%):**\n*   Invesco India Short Duration Fund (debt_short_term): Aligns with the Short Term Debt category.\n*   Invesco India Corporate Bond Fund (debt_corporate_bond): Aligns with the Corporate Bond category.\n\nSince no weighting of equity funds is prescribed, the available MidCap fund is of a significant size with a good return. While data extraction was limited and indicative ratings are missing, the fund categories are adequately represented. This initial allocation assumes an equal distribution within equity and debt components (e.g., equal allocation to Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap, and to Short Term Debt and Corporate Bond). Further refinement may be needed based on fund-specific metrics such as expense ratio, AUM, and risk-adjusted returns, once available from dedicated financial data APIs. The allocation_plan_json object reflects this fund alignment and adheres to the risk-return policy.\n\n**Caveats and Risks:**\n\nThe lack of comprehensive fund ratings and performance data presents a significant risk. Relying solely on fund categories without detailed analysis can lead to suboptimal investment choices. Further analysis of each fund's expense ratio, tracking error, fund manager tenure, and risk-adjusted returns is crucial before making any final allocation decisions. The current allocation assumes a consistent risk profile for all funds within a category, which may not be accurate. Market fluctuations and fund-specific events can also significantly impact the performance of these funds. This initial allocation should be considered a starting point, subject to continuous monitoring and adjustments based on market conditions and fund performance. Without a deeper dive and due diligence this investment strategy is risky.\n",
