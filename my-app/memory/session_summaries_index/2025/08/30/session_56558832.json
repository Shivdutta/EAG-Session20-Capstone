The average mid-cap growth fund is up 16.30% in 2024, significantly lagging the overall US market, which has returned 26.99% as measured by the Morningstar US Market Index . Reflecting a challenging environment, only a handful of funds have consistently ranked at the top of the category in recent years, and most are index funds. Notably, three of the five top performers in our screen tracked the S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth Index . That includes the $1 billion Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth Index Fund IVOG , which has posted a 24.64% year-to-date gain. While it still lags the broader stock market, the fund outperforms its peers by a significant margin over the last one-, three-, and five-year periods. Here are the best-performing mid-cap growth funds, based on our screen: iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth IJK Principal MidCap PMBPX SPDRS&P400 Mid Cap Growth MDYG Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth Index Fund IVOG Virtus KAR Small-Cap Core PKSFX What Are Mid-Cap Growth Funds? Stocks in the middle 20% of the capitalization of the US equity market are defined as mid-cap. Some mid-cap growth portfolios invest in stocks of all sizes, leading to an overall mid-cap profile, while others focus exclusively on mid-cap stocks. Typically, these funds will target US firms projected to grow faster than other mid-cap stocks, which can yield better returns. Growth is defined based on fast growth (high growth rates for earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow) and high valuations (high price ratios and low dividend yields). Mid-Cap Growth Funds vs. the US Stock Market Source: Morningstar. Data as of July 8, 2024. Best-Performing Mid-Cap Growth Funds For this screen, we looked for the mid-cap growth funds that have posted the top returns across multiple periods. We first screened for funds in the top 33% of the category using their lowest-cost share classes over the past one-, three-, and five-year timeframes. In addition, we screened for funds with Morningstar Medalist Ratings of at least Bronze. We also excluded funds with less than $100 million in assets. From this, we highlighted the five funds with the best year-to-date performances. This group consists of three index funds and two actively managed funds. Because the screen was created with the lowest-cost share class for each fund, some funds may be listed with share classes not accessible to individual investors outside of retirement plans. The individual investor versions of those funds may carry higher fees, reducing shareholder returns. A table with the funds returns can be found at the bottom of this article. iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF Morningstar Medalist Rating : Silver Morningstar Rating : 4 stars The $9.5 billion iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF rose 23.43% over the past year.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report reconciles the fund shortlist provided in T012 with the asset allocation strategy outlined in T001. The investment strategy in T001 specifies a 'high' risk appetite, leading to a 70% allocation to equity and 30% to debt.  The recommended fund categories are Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap for equity; and Corporate Bond Funds and Short Duration Funds for debt.\n\nThe reconciliation focuses on matching the funds from the shortlist to these categories and assessing their alignment with the overall investment plan.\n\n**Equity Fund Alignment:**\n\n*   **iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF (IJK):** This fund falls under the Mid-Cap Growth category, which aligns with the recommended Mid Cap Funds category in T001's allocation plan. Therefore, this fund is well-aligned with the equity portion of the investment strategy.  The \"Silver (Morningstar Medalist Rating), 4 stars (Morningstar Rating)\" is a positive indication.\n*   **Principal MidCap Fund (PMBPX):** This is another Mid-Cap Growth fund, aligning with the Mid Cap Funds category specified in T001.  Lack of indicative rating suggests further due diligence.\n*   **SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Growth ETF (MDYG):** Similar to the above, this Mid-Cap Growth ETF fits the allocation plan's equity component. Further due diligence recommended due to the lack of a rating.\n*   **Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth Index Fund (IVOG):** Aligns with the Mid Cap Funds category. Further due diligence recommended due to the lack of a rating.\n*   **Virtus KAR Small-Cap Core Fund (PKSFX):** This Small-Cap Core fund aligns with the Small Cap Funds category recommended in T001. Further due diligence recommended due to the lack of a rating.\n\n**Debt Fund Alignment:**\n\n*   **Nippon India Ultra Short Duration Fund:** This fund belongs to the Ultra Short Duration category, which can be considered a subset of the Short Duration Funds category recommended for debt allocation in T001.  This aligns well with the debt portion of the allocation plan.\n*   **UTI Ultra Short Duration Fund:**  Similar to the above, this fund aligns with the Short Duration Funds category, fulfilling the debt allocation requirements of the investment strategy.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe fund shortlist appears reasonably aligned with the asset allocation plan outlined in T001. All funds from the shortlist fit into either the equity or debt categories recommended in the allocation plan. A few funds are missing indicative ratings, which warrants further investigation. It is important to note that this reconciliation does not constitute a comprehensive fund recommendation; it only verifies the alignment of the provided shortlist with the pre-defined allocation strategy.\n\n**Potential Gaps and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Large Cap Funds:** The allocation plan includes Large Cap Funds, which are not represented in the current shortlist. Depending on the overall investment goals, adding a Large Cap fund may provide additional diversification.\n*   **Specific Fund Selection Criteria:** This reconciliation does not consider specific fund selection criteria such as expense ratios, historical performance, or fund manager expertise. A more in-depth analysis of individual fund characteristics is necessary for making final investment decisions.\n*   **Diversification within Categories:**  The current shortlist might lack sufficient diversification *within* the recommended categories.  For example, having multiple Mid-Cap Growth funds without exposure to other Mid-Cap styles (e.g., value or blend) could introduce concentration risk.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Address the Lack of Large Cap Representation:** Evaluate potential Large Cap funds to include in the portfolio to ensure complete adherence to the recommended categories.\n2.  **Perform Fund-Specific Due Diligence:** Conduct a thorough analysis of each fund's expense ratio, historical performance, and fund manager track record before making any investment decisions.\n3.  **Evaluate Diversification within Categories:** Assess the level of diversification within each asset class (equity and debt) and consider adding funds that represent different styles or strategies within those categories.\n4.  **Regular Portfolio Review:** The allocation plan and fund selections should be regularly reviewed (e.g., annually) to ensure they continue to align with the investor's goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.\n\n**Risks and Warnings:**\n\n*   **Market Volatility:** The value of investments, particularly equity investments, can fluctuate significantly due to market volatility.  This could lead to losses, especially in the short term.\n*   **Interest Rate Risk:** Changes in interest rates can affect the value of debt investments.  Rising interest rates can lead to a decline in the value of bond funds.\n*   **Credit Risk:**  Corporate bond funds are subject to credit risk, which is the risk that the issuer of the bonds will default on its obligations.  This risk is higher for bonds with lower credit ratings.\n*   **Inflation Risk:**  Inflation can erode the real value of investments.  The investment strategy should be designed to outpace inflation over the long term.\n*   **Concentration Risk:** Over-reliance on a few funds or specific categories may expose the portfolio to concentration risk, amplifying the impact of adverse events affecting those specific funds or categories.\n\n**Key Factors Considered:**\n\n*   Asset Allocation Plan (T001):\n    *   Risk Appetite: High\n    *   Equity/Debt Allocation: 70%/30%\n    *   Recommended Equity Categories: Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap\n    *   Recommended Debt Categories: Corporate Bond Funds, Short Duration Funds\n*   Fund Shortlist (T012):\n    *   Fund Names\n    *   Fund Categories\n    *   Indicative Ratings (where available)",

The average mid-cap growth fund is up 16.30% in 2024, significantly lagging the overall US market, which has returned 26.99% as measured by the Morningstar US Market Index . Reflecting a challenging environment, only a handful of funds have consistently ranked at the top of the category in recent years, and most are index funds. Notably, three of the five top performers in our screen tracked the S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth Index . That includes the $1 billion Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth Index Fund IVOG , which has posted a 24.64% year-to-date gain. While it still lags the broader stock market, the fund outperforms its peers by a significant margin over the last one-, three-, and five-year periods. Here are the best-performing mid-cap growth funds, based on our screen: iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth IJK Principal MidCap PMBPX SPDRS&P400 Mid Cap Growth MDYG Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth Index Fund IVOG Virtus KAR Small-Cap Core PKSFX What Are Mid-Cap Growth Funds? Stocks in the middle 20% of the capitalization of the US equity market are defined as mid-cap. Some mid-cap growth portfolios invest in stocks of all sizes, leading to an overall mid-cap profile, while others focus exclusively on mid-cap stocks. Typically, these funds will target US firms projected to grow faster than other mid-cap stocks, which can yield better returns. Growth is defined based on fast growth (high growth rates for earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow) and high valuations (high price ratios and low dividend yields). Mid-Cap Growth Funds vs. the US Stock Market Source: Morningstar. Data as of July 8, 2024. Best-Performing Mid-Cap Growth Funds For this screen, we looked for the mid-cap growth funds that have posted the top returns across multiple periods. We first screened for funds in the top 33% of the category using their lowest-cost share classes over the past one-, three-, and five-year timeframes. In addition, we screened for funds with Morningstar Medalist Ratings of at least Bronze. We also excluded funds with less than $100 million in assets. From this, we highlighted the five funds with the best year-to-date performances. This group consists of three index funds and two actively managed funds. Because the screen was created with the lowest-cost share class for each fund, some funds may be listed with share classes not accessible to individual investors outside of retirement plans. The individual investor versions of those funds may carry higher fees, reducing shareholder returns. A table with the funds returns can be found at the bottom of this article. iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF Morningstar Medalist Rating : Silver Morningstar Rating : 4 stars The $9.5 billion iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF rose 23.43% over the past year.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report reconciles the fund shortlist provided in T012 with the asset allocation strategy outlined in T001. The investment strategy in T001 specifies a 'high' risk appetite, leading to a 70% allocation to equity and 30% to debt.  The recommended fund categories are Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap for equity; and Corporate Bond Funds and Short Duration Funds for debt.\n\nThe reconciliation focuses on matching the funds from the shortlist to these categories and assessing their alignment with the overall investment plan.\n\n**Equity Fund Alignment:**\n\n*   **iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF (IJK):** This fund falls under the Mid-Cap Growth category, which aligns with the recommended Mid Cap Funds category in T001's allocation plan. Therefore, this fund is well-aligned with the equity portion of the investment strategy.  The \"Silver (Morningstar Medalist Rating), 4 stars (Morningstar Rating)\" is a positive indication.\n*   **Principal MidCap Fund (PMBPX):** This is another Mid-Cap Growth fund, aligning with the Mid Cap Funds category specified in T001.  Lack of indicative rating suggests further due diligence.\n*   **SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Growth ETF (MDYG):** Similar to the above, this Mid-Cap Growth ETF fits the allocation plan's equity component. Further due diligence recommended due to the lack of a rating.\n*   **Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth Index Fund (IVOG):** Aligns with the Mid Cap Funds category. Further due diligence recommended due to the lack of a rating.\n*   **Virtus KAR Small-Cap Core Fund (PKSFX):** This Small-Cap Core fund aligns with the Small Cap Funds category recommended in T001. Further due diligence recommended due to the lack of a rating.\n\n**Debt Fund Alignment:**\n\n*   **Nippon India Ultra Short Duration Fund:** This fund belongs to the Ultra Short Duration category, which can be considered a subset of the Short Duration Funds category recommended for debt allocation in T001.  This aligns well with the debt portion of the allocation plan.\n*   **UTI Ultra Short Duration Fund:**  Similar to the above, this fund aligns with the Short Duration Funds category, fulfilling the debt allocation requirements of the investment strategy.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe fund shortlist appears reasonably aligned with the asset allocation plan outlined in T001. All funds from the shortlist fit into either the equity or debt categories recommended in the allocation plan. A few funds are missing indicative ratings, which warrants further investigation. It is important to note that this reconciliation does not constitute a comprehensive fund recommendation; it only verifies the alignment of the provided shortlist with the pre-defined allocation strategy.\n\n**Potential Gaps and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Large Cap Funds:** The allocation plan includes Large Cap Funds, which are not represented in the current shortlist. Depending on the overall investment goals, adding a Large Cap fund may provide additional diversification.\n*   **Specific Fund Selection Criteria:** This reconciliation does not consider specific fund selection criteria such as expense ratios, historical performance, or fund manager expertise. A more in-depth analysis of individual fund characteristics is necessary for making final investment decisions.\n*   **Diversification within Categories:**  The current shortlist might lack sufficient diversification *within* the recommended categories.  For example, having multiple Mid-Cap Growth funds without exposure to other Mid-Cap styles (e.g., value or blend) could introduce concentration risk.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Address the Lack of Large Cap Representation:** Evaluate potential Large Cap funds to include in the portfolio to ensure complete adherence to the recommended categories.\n2.  **Perform Fund-Specific Due Diligence:** Conduct a thorough analysis of each fund's expense ratio, historical performance, and fund manager track record before making any investment decisions.\n3.  **Evaluate Diversification within Categories:** Assess the level of diversification within each asset class (equity and debt) and consider adding funds that represent different styles or strategies within those categories.\n4.  **Regular Portfolio Review:** The allocation plan and fund selections should be regularly reviewed (e.g., annually) to ensure they continue to align with the investor's goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.\n\n**Risks and Warnings:**\n\n*   **Market Volatility:** The value of investments, particularly equity investments, can fluctuate significantly due to market volatility.  This could lead to losses, especially in the short term.\n*   **Interest Rate Risk:** Changes in interest rates can affect the value of debt investments.  Rising interest rates can lead to a decline in the value of bond funds.\n*   **Credit Risk:**  Corporate bond funds are subject to credit risk, which is the risk that the issuer of the bonds will default on its obligations.  This risk is higher for bonds with lower credit ratings.\n*   **Inflation Risk:**  Inflation can erode the real value of investments.  The investment strategy should be designed to outpace inflation over the long term.\n*   **Concentration Risk:** Over-reliance on a few funds or specific categories may expose the portfolio to concentration risk, amplifying the impact of adverse events affecting those specific funds or categories.\n\n**Key Factors Considered:**\n\n*   Asset Allocation Plan (T001):\n    *   Risk Appetite: High\n    *   Equity/Debt Allocation: 70%/30%\n    *   Recommended Equity Categories: Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap\n    *   Recommended Debt Categories: Corporate Bond Funds, Short Duration Funds\n*   Fund Shortlist (T012):\n    *   Fund Names\n    *   Fund Categories\n    *   Indicative Ratings (where available)",
