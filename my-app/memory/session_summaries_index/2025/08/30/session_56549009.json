I also need to justify the allocation percentages based on the 'High' risk appetite and the provided guidelines."

            "summary": "Reconciled fund shortlist from T012 with allocation plan from T001. Recommended debt fund categories to balance the 'High' risk profile allocation.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report aligns the fund shortlist provided in T012 with the asset allocation plan defined in T001, considering a 'High' risk appetite. T001 established a retirement goal of 30,000,000 INR over 10 years, resulting in a SIP amount of 252,371.76 INR per month after inflation adjustment. The 'High' risk appetite maps to an annual return of 12%, and an initial allocation plan of 70% equity and 30% debt. However, the fund shortlist in T012 is primarily focused on 'Large Cap' equity funds, with indications that content extraction from source URLs was incomplete.\n\nTo address the imbalance, this report recommends complementing the existing 'Large Cap' fund focus with debt fund categories. Given the 30% debt allocation requirement, the following debt fund categories are recommended: 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds', as outlined in T001's allocation plan. These categories provide a mix of stability and returns suitable for balancing the portfolio's overall risk profile. The 'Large Cap' funds can fulfill the equity portion of the allocation. Due to incomplete content extraction of T012 fund shortlist, further research is recommended on individual fund selection and performance data for the 'Large Cap' and debt fund categories. \n\nThe revised allocation plan, based on the inputs from T001 and addressing the limitations of T012, is as follows:\n\n*   **Equity (70%):** Large Cap Funds (as identified in T012 and subject to further review)\n*   **Debt (30%):** Corporate Bond Funds, Short Duration Funds\n\nThe rationale for this allocation is rooted in the 'High' risk appetite specified in T001. According to the provided guidelines, a 'High' risk profile corresponds to an aggressive investment strategy, suitable for investors with a longer time horizon and a higher tolerance for market fluctuations. By allocating 70% to equity and 30% to debt, the portfolio aims to achieve the desired growth while mitigating potential downside risks. It's imperative to note that the fund selection within each category should be based on rigorous due diligence, considering factors such as fund performance, expense ratios, and fund manager expertise. The incomplete extraction of fund information in T012 highlights the necessity of conducting additional research to ensure the selection of appropriate funds within each category. Specifically, the unreachability of URLs and the partial content extraction necessitate a more thorough investigation before making any investment decisions. Furthermore, the reliance on URL patterns to infer the category, as noted in T012, introduces a potential source of error, underscoring the need for more precise data verification. Finally, the allocation percentages are based on the guidelines from T001; individual circumstances and preferences may require adjustment. It is recommended that investors consult with a financial advisor to customize the allocation plan to their specific needs and circumstances.",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report aligns the fund shortlist provided in T012 with the asset allocation plan defined in T001, considering a 'High' risk appetite. T001 established a retirement goal of 30,000,000 INR over 10 years, resulting in a SIP amount of 252,371.76 INR per month after inflation adjustment. The 'High' risk appetite maps to an annual return of 12%, and an initial allocation plan of 70% equity and 30% debt. However, the fund shortlist in T012 is primarily focused on 'Large Cap' equity funds, with indications that content extraction from source URLs was incomplete.\n\nTo address the imbalance, this report recommends complementing the existing 'Large Cap' fund focus with debt fund categories. Given the 30% debt allocation requirement, the following debt fund categories are recommended: 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds', as outlined in T001's allocation plan. These categories provide a mix of stability and returns suitable for balancing the portfolio's overall risk profile. The 'Large Cap' funds can fulfill the equity portion of the allocation. Due to incomplete content extraction of T012 fund shortlist, further research is recommended on individual fund selection and performance data for the 'Large Cap' and debt fund categories. \n\nThe revised allocation plan, based on the inputs from T001 and addressing the limitations of T012, is as follows:\n\n*   **Equity (70%):** Large Cap Funds (as identified in T012 and subject to further review)\n*   **Debt (30%):** Corporate Bond Funds, Short Duration Funds\n\nThe rationale for this allocation is rooted in the 'High' risk appetite specified in T001. According to the provided guidelines, a 'High' risk profile corresponds to an aggressive investment strategy, suitable for investors with a longer time horizon and a higher tolerance for market fluctuations. By allocating 70% to equity and 30% to debt, the portfolio aims to achieve the desired growth while mitigating potential downside risks. It's imperative to note that the fund selection within each category should be based on rigorous due diligence, considering factors such as fund performance, expense ratios, and fund manager expertise. The incomplete extraction of fund information in T012 highlights the necessity of conducting additional research to ensure the selection of appropriate funds within each category. Specifically, the unreachability of URLs and the partial content extraction necessitate a more thorough investigation before making any investment decisions. Furthermore, the reliance on URL patterns to infer the category, as noted in T012, introduces a potential source of error, underscoring the need for more precise data verification. Finally, the allocation percentages are based on the guidelines from T001; individual circumstances and preferences may require adjustment. It is recommended that investors consult with a financial advisor to customize the allocation plan to their specific needs and circumstances.",
