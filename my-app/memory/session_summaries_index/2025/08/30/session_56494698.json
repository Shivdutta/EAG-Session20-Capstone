The shortlist from T012 contains large-cap equity funds, which are suitable for the equity portion of the portfolio. However, to achieve a fully diversified 80% equity allocation, additional equity categories such as mid-cap and small-cap funds could be considered. For the 20% debt allocation, categories such as short-term debt funds and corporate bond funds are recommended. The `config` object has been created for downstream math operations with the `annual_return_pct` set to 12, based on the risk/return mapping in the prompt for a 'high' risk appetite. The `inflation_pct` is set to the default value of 5.5%, as the user did not override it.  The `formula_notes` provide context for SIP calculations. The `allocation_plan_json` recommends fund categories suitable for the equity and debt portions of the portfolio.  It's crucial to ensure that the final fund selection aligns with the user's risk tolerance and investment goals.  The risk appetite mapping translates to: very_low: 5%, low: 7%, low_moderate: 8%, moderate: 10%, high_moderate: 11%, high: 12%, very_high: 14%. I used 12% for high. The funds from T012 align with the large cap equity portion, but the allocation plan also mentions other equity fund types.

The shortlist from T012 contains large-cap equity funds, which are suitable for the equity portion of the portfolio. However, to achieve a fully diversified 80% equity allocation, additional equity categories such as mid-cap and small-cap funds could be considered. For the 20% debt allocation, categories such as short-term debt funds and corporate bond funds are recommended. The `config` object has been created for downstream math operations with the `annual_return_pct` set to 12, based on the risk/return mapping in the prompt for a 'high' risk appetite. The `inflation_pct` is set to the default value of 5.5%, as the user did not override it.  The `formula_notes` provide context for SIP calculations. The `allocation_plan_json` recommends fund categories suitable for the equity and debt portions of the portfolio.  It's crucial to ensure that the final fund selection aligns with the user's risk tolerance and investment goals.  The risk appetite mapping translates to: very_low: 5%, low: 7%, low_moderate: 8%, moderate: 10%, high_moderate: 11%, high: 12%, very_high: 14%. I used 12% for high. The funds from T012 align with the large cap equity portion, but the allocation plan also mentions other equity fund types.  Since the prior step only shortlisted large cap, the user may have to pick additional funds for portfolio diversification and to meet the 80% equity allocation.",
