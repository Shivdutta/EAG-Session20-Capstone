Founded in 1942, the company was conceived in Mumbai by four friendsChampaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil. The four friends founded this company with the idea of creating a challenge to some foreign makeup giants in the Indian market. With time, the company journeyed from being a tiny partnership at the onset of its move to a corporate giant that now throws approximately INR 354 billion as consolidated turnover. It involved decoration and industrial paints, waterproofing, paints, adhesives, and decorations for homes such as modular kitchens and sanitary ware. Asian Paints operates in nearly 15 countries with 27 manufacturing facilities and serves more than 60 countries through its subsidiaries such as Berger International and SCIB Paints. Asian Paints has established its supremacy in the Indian paint industry since 1967 and has retained its standing by continuous innovations and a strong focus on consumers. So well known it is regarded for its professionalism and swiftness in which it has developed that it is now the second-largest paint company in Asia and the eighth largest in the world. Its promise of quality as well as service to customers has established that trust factor to be a trusted brand in domestic and also international markets About Asian Paints The genesis of Asian Paints can be traced back to 1942 and was founded in Bombay (now Mumbai) by four friends: Champaklal H. Choksey, Chimanlal N. Choksi, Suryakant C. Dani, and Arvind R. Vakil. It was a historically unfortunate time for India because it was associated with the Quit India Movement. Since then, there has been a temporary ban on the import of paints, which has provided a great opportunity for the company. Initially named Asian Oil and Paint Company Pvt. Ltd., its activity was maintaining surface coatings and latex for rubber tires. In 1945, the company pioneered the introduction of smaller paint packets to meet local distribution and demand. Asian Paints changed its name to Asian Paints (India) Pvt. Ltd. in 1965 and, in 1973, became a public limited company. And so, over several decades, the company expanded its national boundaries into many international countries with a wide range of subsidiaries and joint ventures. By 1967, Asian Paints had established its presence as the market leader in India's paint industry, and it has since maintained that status without fail. It is now considered the second-largest paint manufacturer in Asia and ranks eighth in the world , with more than 15 countries and 27 worldwide manufacturing facilities. Innovative marketing strategies and a strong consumer focus have contributed significantly to the company's sustained growth and success in this highly competitive paints industry.

Founded in 1942, the company was conceived in Mumbai by four friendsChampaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil. The four friends founded this company with the idea of creating a challenge to some foreign makeup giants in the Indian market. With time, the company journeyed from being a tiny partnership at the onset of its move to a corporate giant that now throws approximately INR 354 billion as consolidated turnover. It involved decoration and industrial paints, waterproofing, paints, adhesives, and decorations for homes such as modular kitchens and sanitary ware. Asian Paints operates in nearly 15 countries with 27 manufacturing facilities and serves more than 60 countries through its subsidiaries such as Berger International and SCIB Paints. Asian Paints has established its supremacy in the Indian paint industry since 1967 and has retained its standing by continuous innovations and a strong focus on consumers. So well known it is regarded for its professionalism and swiftness in which it has developed that it is now the second-largest paint company in Asia and the eighth largest in the world. Its promise of quality as well as service to customers has established that trust factor to be a trusted brand in domestic and also international markets About Asian Paints The genesis of Asian Paints can be traced back to 1942 and was founded in Bombay (now Mumbai) by four friends: Champaklal H. Choksey, Chimanlal N. Choksi, Suryakant C. Dani, and Arvind R. Vakil. It was a historically unfortunate time for India because it was associated with the Quit India Movement. Since then, there has been a temporary ban on the import of paints, which has provided a great opportunity for the company. Initially named Asian Oil and Paint Company Pvt. Ltd., its activity was maintaining surface coatings and latex for rubber tires. In 1945, the company pioneered the introduction of smaller paint packets to meet local distribution and demand. Asian Paints changed its name to Asian Paints (India) Pvt. Ltd. in 1965 and, in 1973, became a public limited company. And so, over several decades, the company expanded its national boundaries into many international countries with a wide range of subsidiaries and joint ventures. By 1967, Asian Paints had established its presence as the market leader in India's paint industry, and it has since maintained that status without fail. It is now considered the second-largest paint manufacturer in Asia and ranks eighth in the world , with more than 15 countries and 27 worldwide manufacturing facilities. Innovative marketing strategies and a strong consumer focus have contributed significantly to the company's sustained growth and success in this highly competitive paints industry.
