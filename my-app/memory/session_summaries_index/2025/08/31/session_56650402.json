I need to process a specific investment scenario, which I will define as: Goal 'Retirement', target of 1 Crore INR in 30 years, with a 'high' risk appetite. My process is: 1. Normalize these inputs into goal_input_json. 2. Calculate the future value of the target amount adjusted for 5.5% inflation over 30 years. 3. Based on the 'high' risk appetite, use a 12% annual return to calculate the required monthly SIP to reach the inflation-adjusted target. 4. Determine the asset allocation (equity/debt split) for a 'high' risk profile. 5. Generate a full month-by-month projection table for the entire 30-year (360-month) period using the specified compound interest formula.

They are often considered the foundation for building long-term wealth. This data-driven analysis ranks the leading large-cap mutual funds based on their 10-year CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate). We provide a comprehensive overview including their AUM (Assets Under Management), 5-year returns, risk profiles, and investment minimums to help you make an informed decision. Top 5 Large Cap Funds Performance Overview Fund Name 10-Year Returns (CAGR) 5-Year Returns (CAGR) AUM (in Crores) Risk Level Minimum Investment Nippon India Large Cap Fund 22.47% 21.26% 41,750 High (Equity) Crisil Rating: 5 100 (Lump Sum) ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund 19.91% 19.83% 69,763 High (Equity) Crisil Rating: 5 100 (Lump Sum) Invesco Large Cap Fund 19.44% 20.99% 1,488 High (Equity) Crisil Rating: 4 Typically 100-5,000 DSP Large Cap Fund 19.07% 21.22% 6,036 High (Equity) Crisil Rating: Not available 100 (Lump Sum) HDFC Large Cap Fund 18.51% 16.80% 37,716 High (Equity) Crisil Rating: 3 Typically 100-5,000 Visual Performance Dashboard 10-Year Annualized Returns (CAGR) 5-Year Annualized Returns (CAGR) Assets Under Management (AUM in Crores) Quick Takeaways Top Performer Nippon India Large Cap Fund leads with a remarkable 10-year CAGR of 22.47%, demonstrating consistent, long-term growth. Newer Entrant Invesco's smaller AUM (1,488 Cr) combined with a strong 19.44% CAGR suggests it's a nimble fund with high growth potential. Risk Management Nippon India and ICICI Prudential both boast a Crisil 5-star rating, indicating a strong balance between high returns and controlled risk. Accessibility With minimum lump-sum investments starting as low as 100, these funds are highly accessible to all types of investors. Deep Diving into Funds 1. Nippon India Large Cap Fund Case Study: Historically, this fund has outperformed the Nifty 50 benchmark by approximately 4% annually during the 2015-2021 bull cycle. Why It Works: The strategy involves a strong focus on high-quality blue-chip stocks and disciplined, frequent portfolio rebalancing to adapt to market conditions. 2. ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund Investor Example: A monthly SIP of 10,000 started in 2014 would have grown to approximately 6.2 lakhs by May 2025, realizing a CAGR close to 19.9%. Key Strategy: The fund employs a dynamic strategy of rotating into financials and consumer staples sectors, particularly when these businesses are in a downswing, capitalizing on value opportunities. 3. Invesco Large Cap Fund Growth Spotlight: Its smaller AUM allows for more dexterity, enabling strategic bets on potential mid-cap companies that are on the cusp of entering the large-cap space. New Direction: The fund has been actively increasing its exposure to technology stocks to capitalize on the growth wave driven by AI adoption. 4. DSP Large Cap Fund 5-Year Blast: Achieved an impressive 5-year CAGR of 21.22%, one of the highest in the category, largely due to successful positions in emerging leaders, including the renewable energy sector. Risk Note: The Crisil rating was under observation following the July rating cycle, which is a point for investors to monitor. 5. HDFC Large Cap Fund ( Details ) Value Fund Attraction: The fund's more modest 5-year performance points to a deep value investing approach, focusing on cyclical companies that may be temporarily undervalued by the market.

However, it identifies critical data gaps for Small Cap equity funds and investable Government Securities funds, rendering the current plan incomplete and requiring further action.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The objective of this task is to merge the strategic investment plan defined in step T001 with the concrete fund shortlist generated in step T012. The strategic plan, designed for a 'high' risk appetite, dictates a portfolio composition of 70% in Equity and 30% in Debt. The monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) contribution to achieve the financial goal is calculated to be ₹14,260.36.\n\nThe reconciliation process involves examining each fund category recommended in the allocation plan and identifying corresponding funds from the provided shortlist.\n\n**Equity Allocation (70% of Portfolio):**\nThe plan requires diversification across three equity categories:\n1.  **Large Cap Funds:** The shortlist provided a strong set of three well-established funds: Nippon India Large Cap, ICICI Prudential Bluechip, and Invesco India Largecap. These funds align with the plan's requirement for a stable, large-cap anchor in the equity portion.\n2.  **Mid Cap Funds:** The shortlist identified four suitable funds, including top performers like Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund and large AUM funds like HDFC Mid-Cap Opportunities. This successfully fulfills the mid-cap allocation requirement, aimed at capturing higher growth potential than large caps.\n3.  **Small Cap Funds:** This category represents a critical failure point in the data pipeline. The shortlist explicitly states 'Data Not Available' for Small Cap funds, as the preceding retrieval step failed. For a 'high' risk portfolio, the absence of a small-cap component is a significant deviation from the strategy, as this asset class is a primary driver of aggressive growth. The plan cannot be finalized without addressing this gap.\n\n**Debt Allocation (30% of Portfolio):**\nThe plan specifies two categories for the debt portion to provide stability and capital preservation:\n1.  **Corporate Bond Funds:** The shortlist successfully identified three high-quality corporate bond funds from major asset management companies: ICICI Prudential, HDFC, and Aditya Birla Sun Life. These funds, with their large AUM and consistent track records, are appropriate for the debt allocation.\n2.  **Government Securities:** Similar to the small-cap issue, there is a mismatch here. The allocation plan requires an investment in Government Securities, typically via Gilt Mutual Funds. However, the data provided in the shortlist was not a list of investable funds but rather economic data on benchmark 10-Year G-Sec yields. While useful for context, it does not provide an actionable investment vehicle. Therefore, this part of the allocation remains unfulfilled.\n\nIn conclusion, while the reconciliation process has been successful for three of the five required categories, the two significant data gaps prevent the creation of a complete and diversified portfolio that aligns with the user's high-risk profile. The output below formalizes these findings and provides clear recommendations for the next steps.",

            "detailed": {
              "Executive Summary": "This report outlines a strategic financial plan designed to achieve your retirement goal of ₹1 Crore in 30 years. After accounting for a projected average inflation rate of 5.5% per annum, the inflation-adjusted target corpus required in 30 years is approximately ₹4.98 Crore. Our analysis indicates that a monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of ₹14,260 is required to reach this target, based on an assumed annualized return of 12%, which is consistent with your stated 'high' risk appetite. The corresponding asset allocation strategy is 70% in Equity for long-term growth and 30% in Debt for stability. It is critical to note that while the financial calculations and strategic framework are validated and sound, the plan is **not yet actionable**. The fund identification process revealed crucial data gaps for essential asset categories (Small Cap equity and Government Securities), which must be resolved before any investment decisions are made.",
              "Allocation Notes": "The recommended 70/30 asset allocation between Equity and Debt is a direct reflection of your 'high' risk tolerance and the long 30-year investment horizon. The substantial 70% allocation to equity is designed to be the primary engine of wealth creation, harnessing the power of compounding over three decades to significantly outpace inflation and generate capital appreciation. This equity portion is strategically intended for diversification across Large Cap funds (for stability), Mid Cap funds (for balanced growth), and Small Cap funds (for aggressive growth). The 30% allocation to debt instruments, such as Corporate Bonds and Government Securities, plays a crucial role as a portfolio stabilizer. It is designed to mitigate the inherent volatility of the equity markets, preserve capital during downturns, and provide a more predictable, albeit lower, return stream, thereby creating a balanced risk-adjusted portfolio.",
              "Key Recommendations": "To transition this financial plan from a strategic framework to an executable portfolio, the following actions must be taken in order of priority:\n\n1.  **Address Critical Data Gaps (High Priority):** The immediate and most important next step is to complete the fund selection process. The initial analysis failed to identify suitable investment options for the 'Small Cap Funds' and 'Government Securities (Gilt Funds)' categories. These are integral to the strategy's success and not optional. A new, targeted data retrieval and analysis effort must be initiated to populate these categories with high-quality funds.\n\n2.  **Define Sub-Allocation Percentages (Medium Priority):** Once a complete list of funds across all five categories is finalized, a precise sub-allocation strategy must be defined. The 70% equity and 30% debt allocations must be broken down further (e.g., Equity: 30% Large Cap, 25% Mid Cap, 15% Small Cap). This will provide clear, actionable guidance on how to distribute the monthly SIP of ₹14,260 across the selected funds.\n\n3.  **Conduct Portfolio Overlap Analysis (Low Priority):** After the fund list and sub-allocations are finalized, a portfolio overlap analysis is recommended. This diligence step ensures that the combined portfolio does not have an unintended over-concentration in the same underlying stocks held by multiple funds, thereby maintaining true diversification.",
              "Risk Factors and Uncertainties": "This financial plan is a forward-looking projection based on a set of assumptions that carry inherent risks and uncertainties. It is imperative to understand these factors before committing capital.\n\n**Market Risk:** The projected 12% annualized return is an estimate derived from historical data for high-risk portfolios and is not guaranteed. Equity markets are inherently volatile, and returns can fluctuate significantly year-on-year. The value of your investments can decline, and there may be prolonged periods of underperformance. The long time horizon helps mitigate this risk but does not eliminate it.\n\n**Projection and Assumption Risk:** The plan's success is highly sensitive to its core assumptions. If the actual long-term average return falls below 12%, or if inflation consistently exceeds the assumed 5.5%, the final corpus will be smaller than the target. Such deviations would necessitate a future increase in the monthly SIP amount or an extension of the investment horizon to meet the goal.\n\n**Execution Risk due to Incompleteness:** This is the most immediate and critical risk. The plan is currently incomplete due to missing data for Small Cap and Government Securities funds. Acting on this partial plan would result in a misaligned portfolio that lacks the intended high-growth and full diversification elements. This would not match your risk profile and would significantly compromise the probability of achieving the financial goal.\n\n**Fund-Specific Risks:** Each mutual fund carries its own set of risks related to its investment strategy, the performance of the fund management team, and the credit quality of its underlying holdings (especially for debt funds). Past performance is not indicative of future results, and all scheme-related documents should be reviewed carefully."

After accounting for a projected average inflation rate of 5.5% per annum, the inflation-adjusted target corpus required in 30 years is approximately ₹4.98 Crore. Our analysis indicates that a monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of ₹14,260 is required to reach this target, based on an assumed annualized return of 12%, which is consistent with your stated 'high' risk appetite. The corresponding asset allocation strategy is 70% in Equity for long-term growth and 30% in Debt for stability. It is critical to note that while the financial calculations and strategic framework are validated and sound, the plan is <strong>not yet actionable</strong>. The fund identification process revealed crucial data gaps for essential asset categories (Small Cap equity and Government Securities), which must be resolved before any investment decisions are made.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"goal-inputs\">\n        <h2>📋 Goal Inputs</h2>\n        <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n            <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Goal</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">Retirement</p>\n            </div>\n             <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Target Amount</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">₹1,00,00,000</p>\n            </div>\n             <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Time Horizon</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">30 Years (360 Months)</p>\n            </div>\n             <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Risk Appetite</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value capitalize\">high</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"inflation-adjustment\">\n        <h2>💨 Inflation Adjustment</h2>\n        <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n             <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Assumed Annual Inflation</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">5.5%</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Future Value of Target</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">₹4,98,39,494</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"sip-calculation\">\n        <h2>💰 SIP Calculation</h2>\n         <div class=\"summary-card text-center\">\n            <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Required Monthly SIP</p>\n            <p class=\"summary-card-value text-3xl text-green-600\">₹14,260</p>\n            <p class=\"text-gray-600 mt-2\">Based on an assumed 12% annualized return to meet the inflation-adjusted goal.</p>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"asset-allocation\">\n        <h2>⚖️ Asset Allocation Plan</h2>\n        <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n            <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Equity Allocation</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">70%</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Debt Allocation</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">30%</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mt-4 p-4 border rounded-lg\">\n            <h3 class=\"font-bold mb-2\">Recommended Fund Categories:</h3>\n            <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\">\n                <li><strong>Equity:</strong> Large Cap Funds, Mid Cap Funds, Small Cap Funds</li>\n                <li><strong>Debt:</strong> Corporate Bond Funds, Government Securities</li>\n                <li>ELSS Optional for tax saving</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"allocation-notes\">\n        <h2>📝 Allocation Notes</h2>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The recommended 70/30 asset allocation between Equity and Debt is a direct reflection of your 'high' risk tolerance and the long 30-year investment horizon. The substantial 70% allocation to equity is designed to be the primary engine of wealth creation, harnessing the power of compounding over three decades to significantly outpace inflation and generate capital appreciation. This equity portion is strategically intended for diversification across Large Cap funds (for stability), Mid Cap funds (for balanced growth), and Small Cap funds (for aggressive growth). The 30% allocation to debt instruments, such as Corporate Bonds and Government Securities, plays a crucial role as a portfolio stabilizer. It is designed to mitigate the inherent volatility of the equity markets, preserve capital during downturns, and provide a more predictable, albeit lower, return stream, thereby creating a balanced risk-adjusted portfolio.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"key-recommendations\">\n        <h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2>\n        <div class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4\">\n            <p>To transition this financial plan from a strategic framework to an executable portfolio, the following actions must be taken in order of priority:</p>\n            <ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2\">\n              <li><strong>Address Critical Data Gaps (High Priority):</strong> The immediate and most important next step is to complete the fund selection process. The initial analysis failed to identify suitable investment options for the 'Small Cap Funds' and 'Government Securities (Gilt Funds)' categories. These are integral to the strategy's success and not optional. A new, targeted data retrieval and analysis effort must be initiated to populate these categories with high-quality funds.</li>\n              <li><strong>Define Sub-Allocation Percentages (Medium Priority):</strong> Once a complete list of funds across all five categories is finalized, a precise sub-allocation strategy must be defined. The 70% equity and 30% debt allocations must be broken down further (e.g., Equity: 30% Large Cap, 25% Mid Cap, 15% Small Cap). This will provide clear, actionable guidance on how to distribute the monthly SIP of ₹14,260 across the selected funds.</li>\n              <li><strong>Conduct Portfolio Overlap Analysis (Low Priority):</strong> After the fund list and sub-allocations are finalized, a portfolio overlap analysis is recommended. This diligence step ensures that the combined portfolio does not have an unintended over-concentration in the same underlying stocks held by multiple funds, thereby maintaining true diversification.</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"risk-factors\">\n        <h2>⚠️ Risk Factors & Uncertainties</h2>\n        <div class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3\">\n            <p>This financial plan is a forward-looking projection based on a set of assumptions that carry inherent risks and uncertainties. It is imperative to understand these factors before committing capital.</p>\n            <p><strong>Market Risk:</strong> The projected 12% annualized return is an estimate derived from historical data for high-risk portfolios and is not guaranteed. Equity markets are inherently volatile, and returns can fluctuate significantly year-on-year. The value of your investments can decline, and there may be prolonged periods of underperformance. The long time horizon helps mitigate this risk but does not eliminate it.</p>\n            <p><strong>Projection and Assumption Risk:</strong> The plan's success is highly sensitive to its core assumptions. If the actual long-term average return falls below 12%, or if inflation consistently exceeds the assumed 5.5%, the final corpus will be smaller than the target. Such deviations would necessitate a future increase in the monthly SIP amount or an extension of the investment horizon to meet the goal.</p>\n            <p><strong>Execution Risk due to Incompleteness:</strong> This is the most immediate and critical risk. The plan is currently incomplete due to missing data for Small Cap and Government Securities funds. Acting on this partial plan would result in a misaligned portfolio that lacks the intended high-growth and full diversification elements. This would not match your risk profile and would significantly compromise the probability of achieving the financial goal.</p>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n

They are often considered the foundation for building long-term wealth. This data-driven analysis ranks the leading large-cap mutual funds based on their 10-year CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate). We provide a comprehensive overview including their AUM (Assets Under Management), 5-year returns, risk profiles, and investment minimums to help you make an informed decision. Top 5 Large Cap Funds Performance Overview Fund Name 10-Year Returns (CAGR) 5-Year Returns (CAGR) AUM (in Crores) Risk Level Minimum Investment Nippon India Large Cap Fund 22.47% 21.26% 41,750 High (Equity) Crisil Rating: 5 100 (Lump Sum) ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund 19.91% 19.83% 69,763 High (Equity) Crisil Rating: 5 100 (Lump Sum) Invesco Large Cap Fund 19.44% 20.99% 1,488 High (Equity) Crisil Rating: 4 Typically 100-5,000 DSP Large Cap Fund 19.07% 21.22% 6,036 High (Equity) Crisil Rating: Not available 100 (Lump Sum) HDFC Large Cap Fund 18.51% 16.80% 37,716 High (Equity) Crisil Rating: 3 Typically 100-5,000 Visual Performance Dashboard 10-Year Annualized Returns (CAGR) 5-Year Annualized Returns (CAGR) Assets Under Management (AUM in Crores) Quick Takeaways Top Performer Nippon India Large Cap Fund leads with a remarkable 10-year CAGR of 22.47%, demonstrating consistent, long-term growth. Newer Entrant Invesco's smaller AUM (1,488 Cr) combined with a strong 19.44% CAGR suggests it's a nimble fund with high growth potential. Risk Management Nippon India and ICICI Prudential both boast a Crisil 5-star rating, indicating a strong balance between high returns and controlled risk. Accessibility With minimum lump-sum investments starting as low as 100, these funds are highly accessible to all types of investors. Deep Diving into Funds 1. Nippon India Large Cap Fund Case Study: Historically, this fund has outperformed the Nifty 50 benchmark by approximately 4% annually during the 2015-2021 bull cycle. Why It Works: The strategy involves a strong focus on high-quality blue-chip stocks and disciplined, frequent portfolio rebalancing to adapt to market conditions. 2. ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund Investor Example: A monthly SIP of 10,000 started in 2014 would have grown to approximately 6.2 lakhs by May 2025, realizing a CAGR close to 19.9%. Key Strategy: The fund employs a dynamic strategy of rotating into financials and consumer staples sectors, particularly when these businesses are in a downswing, capitalizing on value opportunities. 3. Invesco Large Cap Fund Growth Spotlight: Its smaller AUM allows for more dexterity, enabling strategic bets on potential mid-cap companies that are on the cusp of entering the large-cap space. New Direction: The fund has been actively increasing its exposure to technology stocks to capitalize on the growth wave driven by AI adoption. 4. DSP Large Cap Fund 5-Year Blast: Achieved an impressive 5-year CAGR of 21.22%, one of the highest in the category, largely due to successful positions in emerging leaders, including the renewable energy sector. Risk Note: The Crisil rating was under observation following the July rating cycle, which is a point for investors to monitor. 5. HDFC Large Cap Fund ( Details ) Value Fund Attraction: The fund's more modest 5-year performance points to a deep value investing approach, focusing on cyclical companies that may be temporarily undervalued by the market.

            "overall_observations": "Let me think through this: The core task is to map the specific funds from the shortlist (T012) to the generic categories in the allocation plan (T001).

The final output must highlight what is reconciled and, more importantly, what actions are needed to complete the plan."

My plan is to create a structured object that iterates through each required category from the allocation plan and populates it with funds from the shortlist, explicitly noting the status (e.g., 'Funds Identified', 'Data Missing'). This directly aligns with the reconciliation task.",
            "what_was_missed": "Let me think through this: I could just list the funds. However, a better approach is to create a richer object that includes not just the funds, but also a status for each category and clear notes explaining any gaps. This turns a simple mapping into a more valuable analytical step. I should also include the overall allocation percentages from T001 for context.",
            "risk_of_misleading": "Let me think through this: The primary risk is that a user or downstream agent might interpret the output as a complete, ready-to-execute investment plan. This would be dangerous because of the missing fund categories. I must mitigate this by using unambiguous status fields ('Data Missing', 'No Investable Funds Found') and providing actionable recommendations to fill these gaps. The warnings must be prominent.",
            "improvement_opportunities": "Let me think through this: The final structure should be an array of objects, where each object represents a fund category from the original plan. This is cleaner and more scalable than a deeply nested object. Each object should have a consistent schema: `asset_class`, `category_name`, `status`, `notes`, and `recommended_funds`. This ensures the output is predictable and easy for other services to parse."

            "summary": "This report reconciles the strategic asset allocation plan with the shortlisted mutual funds. It successfully maps specific funds for the Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Corporate Bond categories. However, it identifies critical data gaps for Small Cap equity funds and investable Government Securities funds, rendering the current plan incomplete and requiring further action.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The objective of this task is to merge the strategic investment plan defined in step T001 with the concrete fund shortlist generated in step T012. The strategic plan, designed for a 'high' risk appetite, dictates a portfolio composition of 70% in Equity and 30% in Debt. The monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) contribution to achieve the financial goal is calculated to be ₹14,260.36.\n\nThe reconciliation process involves examining each fund category recommended in the allocation plan and identifying corresponding funds from the provided shortlist.\n\n**Equity Allocation (70% of Portfolio):**\nThe plan requires diversification across three equity categories:\n1.  **Large Cap Funds:** The shortlist provided a strong set of three well-established funds: Nippon India Large Cap, ICICI Prudential Bluechip, and Invesco India Largecap. These funds align with the plan's requirement for a stable, large-cap anchor in the equity portion.\n2.  **Mid Cap Funds:** The shortlist identified four suitable funds, including top performers like Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund and large AUM funds like HDFC Mid-Cap Opportunities. This successfully fulfills the mid-cap allocation requirement, aimed at capturing higher growth potential than large caps.\n3.  **Small Cap Funds:** This category represents a critical failure point in the data pipeline. The shortlist explicitly states 'Data Not Available' for Small Cap funds, as the preceding retrieval step failed. For a 'high' risk portfolio, the absence of a small-cap component is a significant deviation from the strategy, as this asset class is a primary driver of aggressive growth. The plan cannot be finalized without addressing this gap.\n\n**Debt Allocation (30% of Portfolio):**\nThe plan specifies two categories for the debt portion to provide stability and capital preservation:\n1.  **Corporate Bond Funds:** The shortlist successfully identified three high-quality corporate bond funds from major asset management companies: ICICI Prudential, HDFC, and Aditya Birla Sun Life. These funds, with their large AUM and consistent track records, are appropriate for the debt allocation.\n2.  **Government Securities:** Similar to the small-cap issue, there is a mismatch here. The allocation plan requires an investment in Government Securities, typically via Gilt Mutual Funds. However, the data provided in the shortlist was not a list of investable funds but rather economic data on benchmark 10-Year G-Sec yields. While useful for context, it does not provide an actionable investment vehicle. Therefore, this part of the allocation remains unfulfilled.\n\nIn conclusion, while the reconciliation process has been successful for three of the five required categories, the two significant data gaps prevent the creation of a complete and diversified portfolio that aligns with the user's high-risk profile. The output below formalizes these findings and provides clear recommendations for the next steps.",

            "detailed": {
              "Executive Summary": "This report outlines a strategic financial plan designed to achieve your retirement goal of ₹1 Crore in 30 years. After accounting for a projected average inflation rate of 5.5% per annum, the inflation-adjusted target corpus required in 30 years is approximately ₹4.98 Crore. Our analysis indicates that a monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of ₹14,260 is required to reach this target, based on an assumed annualized return of 12%, which is consistent with your stated 'high' risk appetite. The corresponding asset allocation strategy is 70% in Equity for long-term growth and 30% in Debt for stability. It is critical to note that while the financial calculations and strategic framework are validated and sound, the plan is **not yet actionable**. The fund identification process revealed crucial data gaps for essential asset categories (Small Cap equity and Government Securities), which must be resolved before any investment decisions are made.",
              "Allocation Notes": "The recommended 70/30 asset allocation between Equity and Debt is a direct reflection of your 'high' risk tolerance and the long 30-year investment horizon. The substantial 70% allocation to equity is designed to be the primary engine of wealth creation, harnessing the power of compounding over three decades to significantly outpace inflation and generate capital appreciation. This equity portion is strategically intended for diversification across Large Cap funds (for stability), Mid Cap funds (for balanced growth), and Small Cap funds (for aggressive growth). The 30% allocation to debt instruments, such as Corporate Bonds and Government Securities, plays a crucial role as a portfolio stabilizer. It is designed to mitigate the inherent volatility of the equity markets, preserve capital during downturns, and provide a more predictable, albeit lower, return stream, thereby creating a balanced risk-adjusted portfolio.",
              "Key Recommendations": "To transition this financial plan from a strategic framework to an executable portfolio, the following actions must be taken in order of priority:\n\n1.  **Address Critical Data Gaps (High Priority):** The immediate and most important next step is to complete the fund selection process. The initial analysis failed to identify suitable investment options for the 'Small Cap Funds' and 'Government Securities (Gilt Funds)' categories. These are integral to the strategy's success and not optional. A new, targeted data retrieval and analysis effort must be initiated to populate these categories with high-quality funds.\n\n2.  **Define Sub-Allocation Percentages (Medium Priority):** Once a complete list of funds across all five categories is finalized, a precise sub-allocation strategy must be defined. The 70% equity and 30% debt allocations must be broken down further (e.g., Equity: 30% Large Cap, 25% Mid Cap, 15% Small Cap). This will provide clear, actionable guidance on how to distribute the monthly SIP of ₹14,260 across the selected funds.\n\n3.  **Conduct Portfolio Overlap Analysis (Low Priority):** After the fund list and sub-allocations are finalized, a portfolio overlap analysis is recommended. This diligence step ensures that the combined portfolio does not have an unintended over-concentration in the same underlying stocks held by multiple funds, thereby maintaining true diversification.",
              "Risk Factors and Uncertainties": "This financial plan is a forward-looking projection based on a set of assumptions that carry inherent risks and uncertainties. It is imperative to understand these factors before committing capital.\n\n**Market Risk:** The projected 12% annualized return is an estimate derived from historical data for high-risk portfolios and is not guaranteed. Equity markets are inherently volatile, and returns can fluctuate significantly year-on-year. The value of your investments can decline, and there may be prolonged periods of underperformance. The long time horizon helps mitigate this risk but does not eliminate it.\n\n**Projection and Assumption Risk:** The plan's success is highly sensitive to its core assumptions. If the actual long-term average return falls below 12%, or if inflation consistently exceeds the assumed 5.5%, the final corpus will be smaller than the target. Such deviations would necessitate a future increase in the monthly SIP amount or an extension of the investment horizon to meet the goal.\n\n**Execution Risk due to Incompleteness:** This is the most immediate and critical risk. The plan is currently incomplete due to missing data for Small Cap and Government Securities funds. Acting on this partial plan would result in a misaligned portfolio that lacks the intended high-growth and full diversification elements. This would not match your risk profile and would significantly compromise the probability of achieving the financial goal.\n\n**Fund-Specific Risks:** Each mutual fund carries its own set of risks related to its investment strategy, the performance of the fund management team, and the credit quality of its underlying holdings (especially for debt funds). Past performance is not indicative of future results, and all scheme-related documents should be reviewed carefully."

After accounting for a projected average inflation rate of 5.5% per annum, the inflation-adjusted target corpus required in 30 years is approximately ₹4.98 Crore. Our analysis indicates that a monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of ₹14,260 is required to reach this target, based on an assumed annualized return of 12%, which is consistent with your stated 'high' risk appetite. The corresponding asset allocation strategy is 70% in Equity for long-term growth and 30% in Debt for stability. It is critical to note that while the financial calculations and strategic framework are validated and sound, the plan is <strong>not yet actionable</strong>. The fund identification process revealed crucial data gaps for essential asset categories (Small Cap equity and Government Securities), which must be resolved before any investment decisions are made.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"goal-inputs\">\n        <h2>📋 Goal Inputs</h2>\n        <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n            <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Goal</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">Retirement</p>\n            </div>\n             <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Target Amount</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">₹1,00,00,000</p>\n            </div>\n             <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Time Horizon</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">30 Years (360 Months)</p>\n            </div>\n             <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Risk Appetite</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value capitalize\">high</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"inflation-adjustment\">\n        <h2>💨 Inflation Adjustment</h2>\n        <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n             <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Assumed Annual Inflation</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">5.5%</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Future Value of Target</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">₹4,98,39,494</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"sip-calculation\">\n        <h2>💰 SIP Calculation</h2>\n         <div class=\"summary-card text-center\">\n            <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Required Monthly SIP</p>\n            <p class=\"summary-card-value text-3xl text-green-600\">₹14,260</p>\n            <p class=\"text-gray-600 mt-2\">Based on an assumed 12% annualized return to meet the inflation-adjusted goal.</p>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"asset-allocation\">\n        <h2>⚖️ Asset Allocation Plan</h2>\n        <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n            <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Equity Allocation</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">70%</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"summary-card\">\n                <p class=\"summary-card-title\">Debt Allocation</p>\n                <p class=\"summary-card-value\">30%</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mt-4 p-4 border rounded-lg\">\n            <h3 class=\"font-bold mb-2\">Recommended Fund Categories:</h3>\n            <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside\">\n                <li><strong>Equity:</strong> Large Cap Funds, Mid Cap Funds, Small Cap Funds</li>\n                <li><strong>Debt:</strong> Corporate Bond Funds, Government Securities</li>\n                <li>ELSS Optional for tax saving</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"allocation-notes\">\n        <h2>📝 Allocation Notes</h2>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed\">The recommended 70/30 asset allocation between Equity and Debt is a direct reflection of your 'high' risk tolerance and the long 30-year investment horizon. The substantial 70% allocation to equity is designed to be the primary engine of wealth creation, harnessing the power of compounding over three decades to significantly outpace inflation and generate capital appreciation. This equity portion is strategically intended for diversification across Large Cap funds (for stability), Mid Cap funds (for balanced growth), and Small Cap funds (for aggressive growth). The 30% allocation to debt instruments, such as Corporate Bonds and Government Securities, plays a crucial role as a portfolio stabilizer. It is designed to mitigate the inherent volatility of the equity markets, preserve capital during downturns, and provide a more predictable, albeit lower, return stream, thereby creating a balanced risk-adjusted portfolio.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"key-recommendations\">\n        <h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2>\n        <div class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4\">\n            <p>To transition this financial plan from a strategic framework to an executable portfolio, the following actions must be taken in order of priority:</p>\n            <ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2\">\n              <li><strong>Address Critical Data Gaps (High Priority):</strong> The immediate and most important next step is to complete the fund selection process. The initial analysis failed to identify suitable investment options for the 'Small Cap Funds' and 'Government Securities (Gilt Funds)' categories. These are integral to the strategy's success and not optional. A new, targeted data retrieval and analysis effort must be initiated to populate these categories with high-quality funds.</li>\n              <li><strong>Define Sub-Allocation Percentages (Medium Priority):</strong> Once a complete list of funds across all five categories is finalized, a precise sub-allocation strategy must be defined. The 70% equity and 30% debt allocations must be broken down further (e.g., Equity: 30% Large Cap, 25% Mid Cap, 15% Small Cap). This will provide clear, actionable guidance on how to distribute the monthly SIP of ₹14,260 across the selected funds.</li>\n              <li><strong>Conduct Portfolio Overlap Analysis (Low Priority):</strong> After the fund list and sub-allocations are finalized, a portfolio overlap analysis is recommended. This diligence step ensures that the combined portfolio does not have an unintended over-concentration in the same underlying stocks held by multiple funds, thereby maintaining true diversification.</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"risk-factors\">\n        <h2>⚠️ Risk Factors & Uncertainties</h2>\n        <div class=\"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3\">\n            <p>This financial plan is a forward-looking projection based on a set of assumptions that carry inherent risks and uncertainties. It is imperative to understand these factors before committing capital.</p>\n            <p><strong>Market Risk:</strong> The projected 12% annualized return is an estimate derived from historical data for high-risk portfolios and is not guaranteed. Equity markets are inherently volatile, and returns can fluctuate significantly year-on-year. The value of your investments can decline, and there may be prolonged periods of underperformance. The long time horizon helps mitigate this risk but does not eliminate it.</p>\n            <p><strong>Projection and Assumption Risk:</strong> The plan's success is highly sensitive to its core assumptions. If the actual long-term average return falls below 12%, or if inflation consistently exceeds the assumed 5.5%, the final corpus will be smaller than the target. Such deviations would necessitate a future increase in the monthly SIP amount or an extension of the investment horizon to meet the goal.</p>\n            <p><strong>Execution Risk due to Incompleteness:</strong> This is the most immediate and critical risk. The plan is currently incomplete due to missing data for Small Cap and Government Securities funds. Acting on this partial plan would result in a misaligned portfolio that lacks the intended high-growth and full diversification elements. This would not match your risk profile and would significantly compromise the probability of achieving the financial goal.</p>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n
