A standard classification categorises equity funds based on market capitalisation. Market cap is the value of total outstanding shares trading in the stock market. Mutual Fund Market Capitalization in India Mutual funds are categorised as follows based on the market capitalisation of portfolio companies: large-cap funds, mid-cap funds, small-cap funds, multi-cap funds, and Flexi-cap funds. Large-Cap Equity Funds: Meaning And Key Features Large-cap companies are the first 100 companies in an index, such as the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE), based on market capitalisation. The BSE100 includes the largest companies listed on the BSE, and the NSE100 represents the 100 largest companies on the NSE. As per SEBIs guidelines, large-cap funds should invest at least 80% of the funds total assets in equity and equity-related instruments of large-cap companies. Examples of equity-related instruments include convertible preference shares and convertible debentures. Mid-Cap Equity Funds: Meaning And Key Features Based on SEBIs classification, mid-cap companies rank 101st-250th in terms of market capitalisation in an index. NIFTY Midcap 100 covers the countrys top 100 midcaps listed on the NSE. The BSE mid-cap index includes the top 100 mid-caps listed on the BSE. Mid-cap companies offer higher growth potential than large-cap companies but are also riskier in comparison. As per SEBIs mandate, a mid-cap mutual fund must invest at least 65% of its total assets in equity and equity-related instruments of mid-cap companies. Small-Cap Equity Funds: Meaning And Key Features Small-cap companies start from 250 th in the index in terms of market capitalization . The NIFTY Small Cap 100 and BSE 250 SmallCap include the first 100 and first 250 small-cap companies listed on the NSE and the BSE. SEBI requires small-cap equity funds to invest at least 65% of their funds in equity and equity-related instruments of small-cap companies. Multi-Cap Equity Funds: Meaning And Key Features Multi-cap equity funds invest in stocks of all market capitalisation sizes, including large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies. SEBI requires multi-cap equity funds to invest at least 75% of their funds in equity and equity-related instruments of companies of all sizes. Recently, SEBI has mandated multi-cap equity funds to invest at least 25% each in stocks of each category, i.e., large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap. Before this mandate, multi-cap funds had a large-cap bias, with most of their funds invested', 'images': [], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.advisorkhoj.com/mutual-funds-research/top-performing-mutual-funds?category=Equity:%20Large%20and%20Mid%20Cap', 'content': 'Best & Top Performing Equity: Large and Mid Cap Mutual Funds in India | Advisorkhoj Please click here if you are not redirected within a few seconds.

By Anshul March 12, 2025, 2:07:44 PM IST (Published) 2 Min Read Debt mutual funds witnessed net outflows of 6,525.56 crore in February 2025, reversing from strong inflows of 1,28,652.58 crore in January. Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. Category-wise performance Outflows: Ultra-short duration funds: 4,281.02 crore Overnight funds and low-duration funds: 2,263.94 crore Money market funds: 275.96 crore Inflows: Liquid funds: 4,976.97 crore Corporate bond funds: 1,064.83 crore Short-duration funds: 473.53 crore Reasons behind the outflows Nehal Meshram, Senior Analyst Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, attributed the redemptions to investors rebalancing portfolios. \"10 out of 16 debt fund categories saw outflows, primarily in short-duration funds. These accounted for 90% of total redemptions,\" Meshram said. She noted that some investors may be shifting to longer-duration bonds in anticipation of interest rate cuts by the RBI. \"Medium to long duration and gilt funds saw marginal inflows, reflecting investor positioning for potential capital appreciation. Gilt funds remain attractive due to their low credit risk and sovereign backing,\" she added. Market outlook Debt fund flows may stabilize as market conditions evolve. Interest rate movements and inflation trends will be key factors influencing investor sentiment in the coming months. Other category performance On the other hand, New fund offers (NFOs) collected 4,029 crore, compared to 4,544 crore in the previous month. Gold ETFs recorded inflows of 1,980 crore, down from 3,751.4 crore. Sectoral and thematic funds saw inflows of 5,711.6 crore, lower than 9,016.6 crore in January.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report aligns a fund shortlist (T012) with a previously defined asset allocation plan (T001). The goal is to provide a structured mapping between recommended fund categories and specific funds available for investment, tailored to a 'moderate' risk appetite. The 'T001' context dictates a 50% equity / 50% debt allocation, with recommended categories including 'Large Cap Funds', 'Mid Cap Funds', 'Small Cap Funds' for equity, and 'Corporate Bond Funds', 'Short Duration Funds', 'Liquid Funds', 'Government Securities' for debt. The 'T012' context provides a shortlist of funds categorized as 'Large & Mid Cap Equity' and 'Debt - Short Duration Fund'/'Short Duration Funds'. These funds are examples of those that fit within the recommended categories.  The 'notes' fields associated with the funds from 'T012' provide additional context, such as the recommended investment horizon. However, it's crucial to remember that these are merely examples, and investors should conduct their own due diligence before making investment decisions.  The allocation plan provided in 'T001' serves as a general guideline. The specific fund selections should be driven by individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions.  Further considerations: While the current analysis focuses on a 'moderate' risk appetite, future iterations should incorporate other risk profiles and adjust the allocation percentages and fund category recommendations accordingly.  It's also essential to highlight the limitations of relying solely on this shortlist. A more comprehensive approach would involve continuously monitoring and updating the fund selection based on performance, expense ratios, and changes in market dynamics. It's recommended to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.  Risk Factors: Investment in mutual funds is subject to market risks. The value of investments can go up or down based on various factors, including market volatility, interest rate changes, and economic conditions. Debt funds are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Equity funds are subject to market fluctuations. Short duration funds may carry credit risk. Fund performance is not guaranteed, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Before investing, read the offer document carefully.  In summary, the mapping between recommended categories and specific funds provides a starting point for building an investment portfolio. The specific fund selections should be based on individual circumstances and a thorough understanding of the associated risks.",

A standard classification categorises equity funds based on market capitalisation. Market cap is the value of total outstanding shares trading in the stock market. Mutual Fund Market Capitalization in India Mutual funds are categorised as follows based on the market capitalisation of portfolio companies: large-cap funds, mid-cap funds, small-cap funds, multi-cap funds, and Flexi-cap funds. Large-Cap Equity Funds: Meaning And Key Features Large-cap companies are the first 100 companies in an index, such as the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE), based on market capitalisation. The BSE100 includes the largest companies listed on the BSE, and the NSE100 represents the 100 largest companies on the NSE. As per SEBIs guidelines, large-cap funds should invest at least 80% of the funds total assets in equity and equity-related instruments of large-cap companies. Examples of equity-related instruments include convertible preference shares and convertible debentures. Mid-Cap Equity Funds: Meaning And Key Features Based on SEBIs classification, mid-cap companies rank 101st-250th in terms of market capitalisation in an index. NIFTY Midcap 100 covers the countrys top 100 midcaps listed on the NSE. The BSE mid-cap index includes the top 100 mid-caps listed on the BSE. Mid-cap companies offer higher growth potential than large-cap companies but are also riskier in comparison. As per SEBIs mandate, a mid-cap mutual fund must invest at least 65% of its total assets in equity and equity-related instruments of mid-cap companies. Small-Cap Equity Funds: Meaning And Key Features Small-cap companies start from 250 th in the index in terms of market capitalization . The NIFTY Small Cap 100 and BSE 250 SmallCap include the first 100 and first 250 small-cap companies listed on the NSE and the BSE. SEBI requires small-cap equity funds to invest at least 65% of their funds in equity and equity-related instruments of small-cap companies. Multi-Cap Equity Funds: Meaning And Key Features Multi-cap equity funds invest in stocks of all market capitalisation sizes, including large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies. SEBI requires multi-cap equity funds to invest at least 75% of their funds in equity and equity-related instruments of companies of all sizes. Recently, SEBI has mandated multi-cap equity funds to invest at least 25% each in stocks of each category, i.e., large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap.

By Anshul March 12, 2025, 2:07:44 PM IST (Published) 2 Min Read Debt mutual funds witnessed net outflows of 6,525.56 crore in February 2025, reversing from strong inflows of 1,28,652.58 crore in January. Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. Category-wise performance Outflows: Ultra-short duration funds: 4,281.02 crore Overnight funds and low-duration funds: 2,263.94 crore Money market funds: 275.96 crore Inflows: Liquid funds: 4,976.97 crore Corporate bond funds: 1,064.83 crore Short-duration funds: 473.53 crore Reasons behind the outflows Nehal Meshram, Senior Analyst Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, attributed the redemptions to investors rebalancing portfolios. \"10 out of 16 debt fund categories saw outflows, primarily in short-duration funds. These accounted for 90% of total redemptions,\" Meshram said. She noted that some investors may be shifting to longer-duration bonds in anticipation of interest rate cuts by the RBI. \"Medium to long duration and gilt funds saw marginal inflows, reflecting investor positioning for potential capital appreciation. Gilt funds remain attractive due to their low credit risk and sovereign backing,\" she added. Market outlook Debt fund flows may stabilize as market conditions evolve. Interest rate movements and inflation trends will be key factors influencing investor sentiment in the coming months. Other category performance On the other hand, New fund offers (NFOs) collected 4,029 crore, compared to 4,544 crore in the previous month. Gold ETFs recorded inflows of 1,980 crore, down from 3,751.4 crore. Sectoral and thematic funds saw inflows of 5,711.6 crore, lower than 9,016.6 crore in January.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report aligns a fund shortlist (T012) with a previously defined asset allocation plan (T001). The goal is to provide a structured mapping between recommended fund categories and specific funds available for investment, tailored to a 'moderate' risk appetite. The 'T001' context dictates a 50% equity / 50% debt allocation, with recommended categories including 'Large Cap Funds', 'Mid Cap Funds', 'Small Cap Funds' for equity, and 'Corporate Bond Funds', 'Short Duration Funds', 'Liquid Funds', 'Government Securities' for debt. The 'T012' context provides a shortlist of funds categorized as 'Large & Mid Cap Equity' and 'Debt - Short Duration Fund'/'Short Duration Funds'. These funds are examples of those that fit within the recommended categories.  The 'notes' fields associated with the funds from 'T012' provide additional context, such as the recommended investment horizon. However, it's crucial to remember that these are merely examples, and investors should conduct their own due diligence before making investment decisions.  The allocation plan provided in 'T001' serves as a general guideline. The specific fund selections should be driven by individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions.  Further considerations: While the current analysis focuses on a 'moderate' risk appetite, future iterations should incorporate other risk profiles and adjust the allocation percentages and fund category recommendations accordingly.  It's also essential to highlight the limitations of relying solely on this shortlist. A more comprehensive approach would involve continuously monitoring and updating the fund selection based on performance, expense ratios, and changes in market dynamics. It's recommended to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.  Risk Factors: Investment in mutual funds is subject to market risks. The value of investments can go up or down based on various factors, including market volatility, interest rate changes, and economic conditions. Debt funds are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Equity funds are subject to market fluctuations. Short duration funds may carry credit risk. Fund performance is not guaranteed, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Before investing, read the offer document carefully.  In summary, the mapping between recommended categories and specific funds provides a starting point for building an investment portfolio. The specific fund selections should be based on individual circumstances and a thorough understanding of the associated risks.",
