The analysis highlights funds that fit the allocation strategy, while acknowledging limitations due to missing expense ratio data and the use of 1-year returns.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The objective is to recommend funds from the `fund_shortlist` (T012) that align with the `allocation_plan_json` (T001). The allocation plan dictates a 70% equity / 30% debt split, based on a 'high' risk appetite. The recommended equity categories are Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap, while debt categories are Corporate Bond Funds and Short Duration Funds.  The ELSS category is optional.\n\nThe `fund_shortlist` includes several funds from PGIM India, Invesco India, Bandhan, Nippon India, Axis, and ICICI Prudential, with their category and 1-year returns. A significant limitation is the absence of expense ratio data for most funds, which is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation. The data source is a mix of direct text and web scraping, implying potential data quality issues.\n\n**Fund Recommendation Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Category Matching:** Prioritize funds where the 'category' field in the `fund_shortlist` exactly matches the recommended equity and debt categories in the `allocation_plan_json`. Some funds may not perfectly fit (e.g., a 'Flexi Cap Fund'), and these require careful consideration.\n2.  **Return Prioritization:** Within each category, prioritize funds with positive 1-year returns. Negative returns should be flagged.\n3.  **Debt Fund Selection:** Select debt funds that fall under the \"Corporate Bond Funds\" category and have positive returns.\n4.  **Equity Fund Selection:** Select equity funds and split the 70% equity allocation among Large Cap, Mid Cap and Small Cap funds.  \n5.  **ELSS consideration**: Since ELSS is optional, an ELSS fund from the shortlist should be mentioned.\n\n**Recommended Funds:**\n\nBased on the above strategy, the following funds are recommended:\n\n**Equity (70%):**\n*   **Large Cap Funds:** PGIM India Large Cap Fund (13.91%). This fund fits directly into the Large Cap category and exhibits positive returns.\n*   **Mid Cap Funds:** PGIM India Midcap Fund (18.90%). This fund aligns with the Mid Cap category and demonstrates substantial returns.\n*   **Small Cap Funds:** PGIM India Small Cap Fund (15.02%) and Invesco India Smallcap Fund (-0.2%) and Bandhan Small Cap Fund (-3.2%). PGIM has good returns while Invesco and Bandhan have negative returns. However the allocation plan requires funds from each of Large Cap, Mid Cap and Small Cap. This has to be considered.\n*   **ELSS (Optional):** PGIM India ELSS Tax Saver Fund (15.44%). This fund provides tax benefits and aligns with the equity allocation. It can be considered as an addition or replacement based on the investor's tax planning needs.\n\n**Debt (30%):**\n*   **Corporate Bond Funds:** Nippon India Corporate Bond Fund (7.07%), Axis Corporate Bond Fund (6.91%), and ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund (6.83%). All three funds belong to the Corporate Bond category and show positive returns.  The selection can be based on fund size or other factors.\n\n**Funds Not Recommended:**\n*   PGIM India Flexi Cap Fund, PGIM India Large and Mid Cap Fund, PGIM India Retirement Fund, PGIM India Multi Cap Fund, PGIM India Healthcare Fund: These funds do not neatly fit into the Large Cap, Mid Cap, or Small Cap categories. While they are equity funds, their categorization is ambiguous and may not align with the intended risk profile of allocating specifically to Large Cap, Mid Cap and Small Cap.\n\n**Risk Factors and Uncertainties:**\n*   **Limited Data:** The absence of expense ratio data hinders a complete assessment of fund suitability.  Investors should seek this information before making decisions.\n*   **Short-Term Returns:** Relying solely on 1-year returns may not be indicative of future performance. Longer-term performance should be considered.\n*   **Market Volatility:** Equity fund performance is subject to market risk.  Diversification across categories can mitigate this risk.\n*   **Debt Fund Risks:** Corporate bond funds carry credit risk and interest rate risk.  A diversified portfolio of debt funds can mitigate these risks.\n*   **Data Source Reliability:** The reliance on web scraping introduces potential data accuracy issues.  Cross-validation with reliable data sources is essential.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Obtain Expense Ratios:** Acquire expense ratio data for all funds before making investment decisions.\n2.  **Review Long-Term Performance:** Evaluate fund performance over longer periods (e.g., 3-year, 5-year) to assess consistency.\n3.  **Diversify Within Categories:** Consider diversifying within each asset class (equity and debt) to mitigate risk.\n4.  **Monitor Fund Performance:** Regularly monitor fund performance and adjust the portfolio as needed.\n5.  **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Seek personalized financial advice from a qualified professional.",

The analysis highlights funds that fit the allocation strategy, while acknowledging limitations due to missing expense ratio data and the use of 1-year returns.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The objective is to recommend funds from the `fund_shortlist` (T012) that align with the `allocation_plan_json` (T001). The allocation plan dictates a 70% equity / 30% debt split, based on a 'high' risk appetite. The recommended equity categories are Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap, while debt categories are Corporate Bond Funds and Short Duration Funds.  The ELSS category is optional.\n\nThe `fund_shortlist` includes several funds from PGIM India, Invesco India, Bandhan, Nippon India, Axis, and ICICI Prudential, with their category and 1-year returns. A significant limitation is the absence of expense ratio data for most funds, which is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation. The data source is a mix of direct text and web scraping, implying potential data quality issues.\n\n**Fund Recommendation Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Category Matching:** Prioritize funds where the 'category' field in the `fund_shortlist` exactly matches the recommended equity and debt categories in the `allocation_plan_json`. Some funds may not perfectly fit (e.g., a 'Flexi Cap Fund'), and these require careful consideration.\n2.  **Return Prioritization:** Within each category, prioritize funds with positive 1-year returns. Negative returns should be flagged.\n3.  **Debt Fund Selection:** Select debt funds that fall under the \"Corporate Bond Funds\" category and have positive returns.\n4.  **Equity Fund Selection:** Select equity funds and split the 70% equity allocation among Large Cap, Mid Cap and Small Cap funds.  \n5.  **ELSS consideration**: Since ELSS is optional, an ELSS fund from the shortlist should be mentioned.\n\n**Recommended Funds:**\n\nBased on the above strategy, the following funds are recommended:\n\n**Equity (70%):**\n*   **Large Cap Funds:** PGIM India Large Cap Fund (13.91%). This fund fits directly into the Large Cap category and exhibits positive returns.\n*   **Mid Cap Funds:** PGIM India Midcap Fund (18.90%). This fund aligns with the Mid Cap category and demonstrates substantial returns.\n*   **Small Cap Funds:** PGIM India Small Cap Fund (15.02%) and Invesco India Smallcap Fund (-0.2%) and Bandhan Small Cap Fund (-3.2%). PGIM has good returns while Invesco and Bandhan have negative returns. However the allocation plan requires funds from each of Large Cap, Mid Cap and Small Cap. This has to be considered.\n*   **ELSS (Optional):** PGIM India ELSS Tax Saver Fund (15.44%). This fund provides tax benefits and aligns with the equity allocation. It can be considered as an addition or replacement based on the investor's tax planning needs.\n\n**Debt (30%):**\n*   **Corporate Bond Funds:** Nippon India Corporate Bond Fund (7.07%), Axis Corporate Bond Fund (6.91%), and ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund (6.83%). All three funds belong to the Corporate Bond category and show positive returns.  The selection can be based on fund size or other factors.\n\n**Funds Not Recommended:**\n*   PGIM India Flexi Cap Fund, PGIM India Large and Mid Cap Fund, PGIM India Retirement Fund, PGIM India Multi Cap Fund, PGIM India Healthcare Fund: These funds do not neatly fit into the Large Cap, Mid Cap, or Small Cap categories. While they are equity funds, their categorization is ambiguous and may not align with the intended risk profile of allocating specifically to Large Cap, Mid Cap and Small Cap.\n\n**Risk Factors and Uncertainties:**\n*   **Limited Data:** The absence of expense ratio data hinders a complete assessment of fund suitability.  Investors should seek this information before making decisions.\n*   **Short-Term Returns:** Relying solely on 1-year returns may not be indicative of future performance. Longer-term performance should be considered.\n*   **Market Volatility:** Equity fund performance is subject to market risk.  Diversification across categories can mitigate this risk.\n*   **Debt Fund Risks:** Corporate bond funds carry credit risk and interest rate risk.  A diversified portfolio of debt funds can mitigate these risks.\n*   **Data Source Reliability:** The reliance on web scraping introduces potential data accuracy issues.  Cross-validation with reliable data sources is essential.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Obtain Expense Ratios:** Acquire expense ratio data for all funds before making investment decisions.\n2.  **Review Long-Term Performance:** Evaluate fund performance over longer periods (e.g., 3-year, 5-year) to assess consistency.\n3.  **Diversify Within Categories:** Consider diversifying within each asset class (equity and debt) to mitigate risk.\n4.  **Monitor Fund Performance:** Regularly monitor fund performance and adjust the portfolio as needed.\n5.  **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Seek personalized financial advice from a qualified professional.",
