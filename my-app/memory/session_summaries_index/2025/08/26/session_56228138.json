This includes fetching fund data, shortlisting funds based on the allocation plan, performing quality assurance, generating charts, formatting the report, and scheduling the report for future updates. The writes names should be consistent so downstream agents can read them. The SIPGoalPlannerAgent has provided `goal_input_json`, `inflation_adjusted_json`, `sip_calc_json`, `allocation_plan_json`.

I have also provided output file names to the coderAgent, and the dependencies are set correctly. The plan is granular and detailed enough for a high-quality consulting project.

Now, as per the SIP-First Routing Rule (v3), I need to assemble the remaining SIP chain (retrieval → distillation → QA → charts → report → scheduler) using the outputs from T001. This includes fetching fund data, shortlisting funds based on the allocation plan, performing quality assurance, generating charts, formatting the report, and scheduling the report for future updates. The writes names should be consistent so downstream agents can read them. The SIPGoalPlannerAgent has provided `goal_input_json`, `inflation_adjusted_json`, `sip_calc_json`, `allocation_plan_json`. Ensure all agent prompts use these outputs and that the dependencies are correctly set.",

I have the outputs from the first agent and will pass them appropriately. All other agents are stateless, and I'm providing the context. I have also provided output file names to the coderAgent, and the dependencies are set correctly. The plan is granular and detailed enough for a high-quality consulting project. CoderAgent will be used appropriately for chart generation and embedding. The dependencies are correctly modeled. The report generation is handled by the appropriate agents, and this follows the SIP-First Routing Rule correctly.",
