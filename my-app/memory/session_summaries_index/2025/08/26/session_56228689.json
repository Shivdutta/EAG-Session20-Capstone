            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report confirms and adjusts the asset allocation plan previously established in step T001, taking into account the user's stated high-risk appetite, the guidelines provided in the initial query, and the SIP Integration Addendum.  T001 outlined a retirement goal of 30,000,000 INR (adjusted to 51,265,774.34 INR for inflation over 10 years) achievable with a monthly SIP of 226,813.23 INR, and initially suggested a 70/30 equity/debt allocation.  Step T012 attempted to identify specific large-cap funds but was unable to extract fund names, only broad categories, due to limitations in web scraping.  Given the 'high' risk appetite and the SIP Integration Addendum, this report recommends an adjustment to the asset allocation to an 80/20 equity/debt split.  This is in line with the 'High' policy outlined in the addendum, which maps a high-risk profile to a more aggressive investment strategy. The rationale is to maximize potential returns over the 10-year investment horizon, acknowledging the increased volatility associated with a higher equity allocation.  \n\nThe recommended fund categories remain the same as in T001: Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap for the equity portion, and Short Term Debt and Long Term Debt for the debt portion.  The absence of specific fund recommendations from T012 reinforces the need for further research and consultation with a qualified financial advisor to select appropriate funds within these categories.  Investors should consider factors such as expense ratios, fund manager performance, and investment objectives before making any investment decisions.  It is crucial to understand that a high-risk allocation carries a greater potential for loss, especially in the short term. While a high-risk strategy aims for higher returns, it's essential to regularly monitor the portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain the desired asset allocation and risk profile.  This allocation is based solely on the information provided and the high-risk appetite declared by the user. It does not constitute financial advice and should not be considered a guarantee of returns. The investment strategy's success depends on various market factors and individual fund performance. Therefore, seeking professional financial advice is strongly recommended before implementing this plan.",

            "summary": "Confirmed allocation plan with slight adjustment to 80/20 equity/debt based on high-risk profile and SIP Integration Addendum.  Fund categories remain the same as T001. Config generated for downstream math.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report confirms and adjusts the asset allocation plan previously established in step T001, taking into account the user's stated high-risk appetite, the guidelines provided in the initial query, and the SIP Integration Addendum.  T001 outlined a retirement goal of 30,000,000 INR (adjusted to 51,265,774.34 INR for inflation over 10 years) achievable with a monthly SIP of 226,813.23 INR, and initially suggested a 70/30 equity/debt allocation.  Step T012 attempted to identify specific large-cap funds but was unable to extract fund names, only broad categories, due to limitations in web scraping.  Given the 'high' risk appetite and the SIP Integration Addendum, this report recommends an adjustment to the asset allocation to an 80/20 equity/debt split.  This is in line with the 'High' policy outlined in the addendum, which maps a high-risk profile to a more aggressive investment strategy. The rationale is to maximize potential returns over the 10-year investment horizon, acknowledging the increased volatility associated with a higher equity allocation.  \n\nThe recommended fund categories remain the same as in T001: Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap for the equity portion, and Short Term Debt and Long Term Debt for the debt portion.  The absence of specific fund recommendations from T012 reinforces the need for further research and consultation with a qualified financial advisor to select appropriate funds within these categories.  Investors should consider factors such as expense ratios, fund manager performance, and investment objectives before making any investment decisions.  It is crucial to understand that a high-risk allocation carries a greater potential for loss, especially in the short term. While a high-risk strategy aims for higher returns, it's essential to regularly monitor the portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain the desired asset allocation and risk profile.  This allocation is based solely on the information provided and the high-risk appetite declared by the user. It does not constitute financial advice and should not be considered a guarantee of returns. The investment strategy's success depends on various market factors and individual fund performance. Therefore, seeking professional financial advice is strongly recommended before implementing this plan.",
