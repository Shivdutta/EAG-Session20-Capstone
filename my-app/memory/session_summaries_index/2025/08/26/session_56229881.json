The SIP config object will be created based on this allocation. However, it is important to note that the retriever agent failed to find equity funds. This significantly impacts the practical application of the allocation plan.  While the 70/30 split remains theoretically sound given the risk appetite, the lack of available equity fund options necessitates a re-evaluation of the investment strategy.  A possible solution could be to initially invest more heavily in debt instruments until the equity fund retrieval issue is resolved.  Alternatively, the user's risk appetite could be reassessed given the limitations in available investment options. The annual return percentage for a high risk appetite is mapped to 12%.  The allocation plan JSON needs to be confirmed and potentially adjusted based on the retrieval issue. The recommended fund categories have been taken from the previous step. This step is also generating config object for SIPContext.",

The SIP config object will be created based on this allocation. However, it is important to note that the retriever agent failed to find equity funds. This significantly impacts the practical application of the allocation plan.  While the 70/30 split remains theoretically sound given the risk appetite, the lack of available equity fund options necessitates a re-evaluation of the investment strategy.  A possible solution could be to initially invest more heavily in debt instruments until the equity fund retrieval issue is resolved.  Alternatively, the user's risk appetite could be reassessed given the limitations in available investment options. The annual return percentage for a high risk appetite is mapped to 12%.  The allocation plan JSON needs to be confirmed and potentially adjusted based on the retrieval issue. The recommended fund categories have been taken from the previous step. This step is also generating config object for SIPContext.",
