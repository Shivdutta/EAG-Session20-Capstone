Initially, the allocation suggested 70% equity and 30% debt. Given the 'high' risk appetite mapping and a desire to align more closely with policy (80/20), the equity allocation is increased to 80% and the debt allocation decreased to 20%. The rationale for this adjustment is to capture higher potential returns over the 10-year investment horizon, aligning with the user's aggressive risk profile. The shift increases exposure to market volatility but fits the risk tolerance expressed.  The equity component will primarily consist of Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap funds, with a specific focus on Flexi Cap funds like HDFC Flexi Cap Fund, JM Flexicap Fund, and Bank of India Flexi Cap Fund, which offer diversification across market capitalizations. The debt component will be allocated to Short Term and Long Term Debt funds to provide stability and hedge against market downturns. ELSS remains optional. The fund categories ensure broad diversification, mitigating risk. The increased equity allocation aims to maximize returns within the stipulated timeframe and aligns with the 'high' risk profile. This configuration aims to balance risk and reward, tailored to the investment goal, timeframe, and risk tolerance.",

Initially, the allocation suggested 70% equity and 30% debt. Given the 'high' risk appetite mapping and a desire to align more closely with policy (80/20), the equity allocation is increased to 80% and the debt allocation decreased to 20%. The rationale for this adjustment is to capture higher potential returns over the 10-year investment horizon, aligning with the user's aggressive risk profile. The shift increases exposure to market volatility but fits the risk tolerance expressed.  The equity component will primarily consist of Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap funds, with a specific focus on Flexi Cap funds like HDFC Flexi Cap Fund, JM Flexicap Fund, and Bank of India Flexi Cap Fund, which offer diversification across market capitalizations. The debt component will be allocated to Short Term and Long Term Debt funds to provide stability and hedge against market downturns. ELSS remains optional. The fund categories ensure broad diversification, mitigating risk. The increased equity allocation aims to maximize returns within the stipulated timeframe and aligns with the 'high' risk profile. This configuration aims to balance risk and reward, tailored to the investment goal, timeframe, and risk tolerance.",
