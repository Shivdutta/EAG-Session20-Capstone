The previous step, T001, involved using SIPGoalPlannerAgent, and the outputs, especially `goal_input_json`, `inflation_adjusted_json`, `sip_calc_json`, and `allocation_plan_json`, are crucial for the subsequent steps. My job now is to assemble the rest of the SIP execution chain. I need to create nodes for retrieving fund data, distilling it, reconciling the shortlist with allocation categories, QA, generating charts and embedding HTML, formatting the output into consulting-grade HTML, generating a comprehensive report, and scheduling optional monthly refreshes. The orchestrator patch requirements (preflight gate and final single-file policy) also need to be kept in mind when creating the final agent calls and the dependency graph.  The agent prompt requires me to create T011-T018. I need to create PlannerAgent calls after T018 to cater for preflight gate and final single-file policy.",
        "initial_plan": "Here's how I think the nodes should be called with these edges: The initial node is T001, which is the SIPGoalPlannerAgent. The subsequent nodes will handle fund data retrieval, distillation, reconciliation, QA, chart generation, formatting, report generation, and scheduling. The last agent must be ReportGeneratorAgent. After T015, I'll have a pre-flight gate to validate the output.",
        "validation_thoughts": "Let me briefly go through my validation checklist... I need to ensure that all dependencies are correctly modeled and that each task is assigned to the appropriate agent. I'll verify that the outputs from T001 are used as inputs for subsequent tasks. The preflight gate and final surface policy requirements must be satisfied. I need to check if SIP trigger true and T001 is absent and if yes, fail the plan. I need to ensure the single file output format.",

However, based on the specified policy in the Orchestrator Agent instructions for a 'high' risk appetite, the asset allocation should be 80% equity and 20% debt. Therefore, the 'equity_percent' has been adjusted to 80, and the 'debt_percent' has been adjusted to 20. The 'recommended_fund_categories' remain the same as in T001, since the fund shortlist provided in T012 contains very limited relevant information and the prompt instructs not to recommend specific fund names, focusing solely on categories. The categories include 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', 'Small Cap' for equity and 'Corporate Bond', 'Short Term Debt' for debt. The 'elss_optional' flag remains as true, allowing for optional tax-saving investments. The 'notes' section in the allocation_plan_json from T001 is retained for completeness. The SIP config object is created to allow for downstream SIP calculations. The annual_return_pct is set to 12 based on the 'high' risk appetite. The inflation_pct defaults to 5.5 as no override was given. The allocation rationale references the categories provided in T001 as the source due to the lack of specific fund names or ratings in T012, ensuring the adherence to the 'fund category only' recommendation policy. \n\nThe rationale for this adjustment is to ensure adherence to the pre-defined risk appetite policies. Deviations can lead to a misalignment between the portfolio's risk profile and the investor's risk tolerance, potentially impacting the achievement of the retirement goal. Maintaining alignment with the stated policy provides consistency and transparency in the asset allocation process.\n",

I need to create nodes for retrieving fund data, distilling it, reconciling the shortlist with allocation categories, QA, generating charts and embedding HTML, formatting the output into consulting-grade HTML, generating a comprehensive report, and scheduling optional monthly refreshes. The orchestrator patch requirements (preflight gate and final single-file policy) also need to be kept in mind when creating the final agent calls and the dependency graph.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The allocation_plan_json from the previous step (T001) indicated a 70% equity and 30% debt allocation. However, based on the specified policy in the Orchestrator Agent instructions for a 'high' risk appetite, the asset allocation should be 80% equity and 20% debt. Therefore, the 'equity_percent' has been adjusted to 80, and the 'debt_percent' has been adjusted to 20. The 'recommended_fund_categories' remain the same as in T001, since the fund shortlist provided in T012 contains very limited relevant information and the prompt instructs not to recommend specific fund names, focusing solely on categories. The categories include 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', 'Small Cap' for equity and 'Corporate Bond', 'Short Term Debt' for debt. The 'elss_optional' flag remains as true, allowing for optional tax-saving investments. The 'notes' section in the allocation_plan_json from T001 is retained for completeness. The SIP config object is created to allow for downstream SIP calculations. The annual_return_pct is set to 12 based on the 'high' risk appetite. The inflation_pct defaults to 5.5 as no override was given. The allocation rationale references the categories provided in T001 as the source due to the lack of specific fund names or ratings in T012, ensuring the adherence to the 'fund category only' recommendation policy. \n\nThe rationale for this adjustment is to ensure adherence to the pre-defined risk appetite policies. Deviations can lead to a misalignment between the portfolio's risk profile and the investor's risk tolerance, potentially impacting the achievement of the retirement goal. Maintaining alignment with the stated policy provides consistency and transparency in the asset allocation process.\n",
