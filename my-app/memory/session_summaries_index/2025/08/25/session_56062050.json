The goal is to provide a SIP plan with asset allocation and fund category guidance. The plan should adhere to the SIP workflow. I'll ensure that the agents receive all necessary inputs from previous tasks and that the final report is well-formatted and comprehensive.

(Yes)\n- Have I provided all output file names to coderAgent? (Yes, chart_data_json and embed_snippet_html)\n- The plan that I will generate will run in Parallel if all dependencies are completed. Have I created appropriate dependencies for CoderAgent, such that it is not triggered without a prior task being completed? (Yes)\n- Am I assuming unknown file contents/business models/technical environments? (No)\n- Are all dependency relationships correctly modeled with simple task IDs? (Yes)\n- Is the plan granular and detailed enough for $100K consulting/coding/programming quality? (Yes)\n- Have I trusted CoderAgent with larger tasks and avoided micromanaging it? (Yes)\n- Am I called DistillerAgent or FormatterAgent after website creation task! That's forbidden!!!! (Not applicable)",

This aligns with the provided policy guidelines. The fund shortlist (T012) includes several 'Equity | Growth' funds, along with 'Flexi Cap', 'Thematic', 'Sectoral' and 'ELSS' options. While the high-level allocation remains at 50/50, the specific equity funds chosen could be influenced by the investor's preference for growth, diversification, or tax benefits (ELSS).  \n\nGiven the 'Moderate' risk appetite, a balanced approach is still recommended. The equity portion should include a mix of Large Cap, Flexi Cap, and Multi Cap funds, as suggested in T001.  The debt portion can be allocated across Short Duration, Corporate Bond, and Liquid funds.  \n\nNo significant changes to the allocation percentages are warranted at this stage, as the user has specified a 'Moderate' risk profile, and a 50/50 equity/debt split is suitable. The focus should be on selecting specific funds within the recommended categories that meet the investor's specific needs and preferences. The fact that a retirement fund is the goal suggests that not taking undo risk is appropriate, but growth is still important. \n\nThe config object below maps the 'Moderate' risk appetite to an annual return percentage of 10%, consistent with the input data. The inflation rate is set to the default of 5.5%. The formulas for SIP calculation and future value inflation adjustment are included for reference in formula_notes field. This is based on the context in T001 (Risk→Return: Moderate = 10% annually; Inflation default = 5.5%). The allocation_plan_json remains as 50/50, since this aligns with the moderate risk apetite.",

Have I created appropriate dependencies for CoderAgent, such that it is not triggered without a prior task being completed? (Yes)\n- Am I assuming unknown file contents/business models/technical environments? (No)\n- Are all dependency relationships correctly modeled with simple task IDs? (Yes)\n- Is the plan granular and detailed enough for $100K consulting/coding/programming quality? (Yes)\n- Have I trusted CoderAgent with larger tasks and avoided micromanaging it?

This aligns with the provided policy guidelines. The fund shortlist (T012) includes several 'Equity | Growth' funds, along with 'Flexi Cap', 'Thematic', 'Sectoral' and 'ELSS' options. While the high-level allocation remains at 50/50, the specific equity funds chosen could be influenced by the investor's preference for growth, diversification, or tax benefits (ELSS).  \n\nGiven the 'Moderate' risk appetite, a balanced approach is still recommended. The equity portion should include a mix of Large Cap, Flexi Cap, and Multi Cap funds, as suggested in T001.  The debt portion can be allocated across Short Duration, Corporate Bond, and Liquid funds.  \n\nNo significant changes to the allocation percentages are warranted at this stage, as the user has specified a 'Moderate' risk profile, and a 50/50 equity/debt split is suitable. The focus should be on selecting specific funds within the recommended categories that meet the investor's specific needs and preferences. The fact that a retirement fund is the goal suggests that not taking undo risk is appropriate, but growth is still important. \n\nThe config object below maps the 'Moderate' risk appetite to an annual return percentage of 10%, consistent with the input data. The inflation rate is set to the default of 5.5%. The formulas for SIP calculation and future value inflation adjustment are included for reference in formula_notes field. This is based on the context in T001 (Risk→Return: Moderate = 10% annually; Inflation default = 5.5%). The allocation_plan_json remains as 50/50, since this aligns with the moderate risk apetite.",
