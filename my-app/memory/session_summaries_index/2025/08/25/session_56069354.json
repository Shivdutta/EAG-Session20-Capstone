Do not build any plans until you have read SIPGoalPlannerAgent’s outputs.  ________________________________________Wiring Requirement  PlannerAgent MUST first read the outputs from SIPGoalPlannerAgent (especially goal_input_json and computed parameters) before creating the final multi-agent plan graph for retrieval, distillation, Q&A, charts, and report.  ________________________________________User Scenario  Plan a SIP goal with asset allocation and fund category guidance:  goal_type = Retirement  current_age = 50  retirement_age = 60  currency = INR  target_amount_min = 30000000  risk_appetite = High  override_time_horizon_years = 10  ________________________________________Compute (Deterministic)  time_horizon_years =  - For Retirement: max(override_time_horizon_years, retirement_age - current_age)  = max(10, 60 - 50) = 10total_months = time_horizon_years * 12  = 10 * 12 = 120Risk → Return mapping (annual):  very_low: 5%  low: 7%  low_moderate: 8%  moderate: 10%  high_moderate: 11%  high: 12%  very_high: 14%  monthly_return_r = annual_return / 12  For this scenario (High): annual_return = 12% → monthly_return_r = 0.12 / 12 = 0.01  Inflation default: 5.5% annually unless overridden.  ________________________________________Do (Step-by-Step)  Normalize inputs → emit goal_input_json.  Refer “SIP Calculation” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.  Refer “Inflation Adjustment” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.  Refer “Recommendation Engine (Fund Category Types)” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.

            "summary": "Adjusted the allocation plan to align with a High risk appetite (80% Equity, 20% Debt) and generated configuration parameters for SIP calculations. Provided rationale based on the specified risk profile and fund categories.",
            "detailed": "Based on the input 'T001', the user's risk appetite is 'High'. The provided allocation plan in 'T001' initially suggested 70% equity and 30% debt. However, according to the predefined policy for 'High' risk appetite, the ideal allocation should be 80% equity and 20% debt. Therefore, the allocation plan has been adjusted to reflect this policy.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1.  **Risk Appetite Alignment:** The allocation is aligned with the 'High' risk appetite indicated in the user's goal ('T001'). An 80/20 equity/debt split is considered aggressive, suitable for investors seeking higher returns over a 10-year investment horizon and willing to accept greater market volatility.\n\n2.  **Equity Allocation (80%):** The equity component is allocated to high-growth potential assets, specifically within the fund categories 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', and 'Small Cap'. The fund shortlist from 'T012' provides options like 'DSP Large Cap Fund', 'ICICI Pru Large Cap Fund', and 'Quant Focused Fund', which can be considered. These funds are expected to deliver significant returns over the long term, albeit with higher risk.\n\n3.  **Debt Allocation (20%):** The debt component provides stability and reduces overall portfolio risk. The 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds' categories are recommended. These funds typically offer lower returns but with less volatility compared to equity funds.\n\n4.  **Fund Shortlist Integration:** The 'T012' input provided a fund shortlist. While the prompt restricts recommending specific fund names, the shortlist helps inform the selection of fund categories. For instance, funds like 'Quant Focused Fund' and 'ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund' indicate strong performance within the Large Cap category, reinforcing the rationale for including Large Cap funds in the equity allocation.\n\n5.  **Inflation and SIP Calculation:** The configuration parameters include an annual return of 12% (High risk appetite) and an inflation rate of 5.5%. These values will be used in subsequent SIP calculations to determine the monthly investment required to reach the target amount, adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe risk appetite 'High' translates to an annual expected return of 12%, as per the pre-defined mapping. The inflation rate is defaulted to 5.5% annually since no override was provided. The asset allocation is adjusted to 80% equity and 20% debt, following the guidelines for a high-risk appetite.\n",

            "summary": "Adjusted the allocation plan to align with a High risk appetite (80% Equity, 20% Debt) and generated configuration parameters for SIP calculations. Provided rationale based on the specified risk profile and fund categories.",
            "detailed": "Based on the input 'T001', the user's risk appetite is 'High'. The provided allocation plan in 'T001' initially suggested 70% equity and 30% debt. However, according to the predefined policy for 'High' risk appetite, the ideal allocation should be 80% equity and 20% debt. Therefore, the allocation plan has been adjusted to reflect this policy.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1.  **Risk Appetite Alignment:** The allocation is aligned with the 'High' risk appetite indicated in the user's goal ('T001'). An 80/20 equity/debt split is considered aggressive, suitable for investors seeking higher returns over a 10-year investment horizon and willing to accept greater market volatility.\n\n2.  **Equity Allocation (80%):** The equity component is allocated to high-growth potential assets, specifically within the fund categories 'Large Cap', 'Mid Cap', and 'Small Cap'. The fund shortlist from 'T012' provides options like 'DSP Large Cap Fund', 'ICICI Pru Large Cap Fund', and 'Quant Focused Fund', which can be considered. These funds are expected to deliver significant returns over the long term, albeit with higher risk.\n\n3.  **Debt Allocation (20%):** The debt component provides stability and reduces overall portfolio risk. The 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds' categories are recommended. These funds typically offer lower returns but with less volatility compared to equity funds.\n\n4.  **Fund Shortlist Integration:** The 'T012' input provided a fund shortlist. While the prompt restricts recommending specific fund names, the shortlist helps inform the selection of fund categories. For instance, funds like 'Quant Focused Fund' and 'ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund' indicate strong performance within the Large Cap category, reinforcing the rationale for including Large Cap funds in the equity allocation.\n\n5.  **Inflation and SIP Calculation:** The configuration parameters include an annual return of 12% (High risk appetite) and an inflation rate of 5.5%. These values will be used in subsequent SIP calculations to determine the monthly investment required to reach the target amount, adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe risk appetite 'High' translates to an annual expected return of 12%, as per the pre-defined mapping. The inflation rate is defaulted to 5.5% annually since no override was provided. The asset allocation is adjusted to 80% equity and 20% debt, following the guidelines for a high-risk appetite.\n",
