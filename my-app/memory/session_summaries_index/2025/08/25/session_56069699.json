Do not build any plans until you have read SIPGoalPlannerAgent’s outputs.  ________________________________________Wiring Requirement  PlannerAgent MUST first read the outputs from SIPGoalPlannerAgent (especially goal_input_json and computed parameters) before creating the final multi-agent plan graph for retrieval, distillation, Q&A, charts, and report.  ________________________________________User Scenario  Plan a SIP goal with asset allocation and fund category guidance:  goal_type = Retirement  current_age = 50  retirement_age = 60  currency = INR  target_amount_min = 30000000  risk_appetite = High  override_time_horizon_years = 10  ________________________________________Compute (Deterministic)  time_horizon_years =  - For Retirement: max(override_time_horizon_years, retirement_age - current_age)  = max(10, 60 - 50) = 10total_months = time_horizon_years * 12  = 10 * 12 = 120Risk → Return mapping (annual):  very_low: 5%  low: 7%  low_moderate: 8%  moderate: 10%  high_moderate: 11%  high: 12%  very_high: 14%  monthly_return_r = annual_return / 12  For this scenario (High): annual_return = 12% → monthly_return_r = 0.12 / 12 = 0.01  Inflation default: 5.5% annually unless overridden.  ________________________________________Do (Step-by-Step)  Normalize inputs → emit goal_input_json.  Refer “SIP Calculation” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.  Refer “Inflation Adjustment” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.  Refer “Recommendation Engine (Fund Category Types)” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.

By Anshul November 13, 2024, 12:50:48 PM IST (Updated) 2 Min Read Large-cap equity mutual funds have recently seen a surge in investor interest. The inflows have more than doubled to 3,452 crore in October 2024 from 1,769 crore in the previous month, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). The increase in inflows mirrors a broader trend of growing investor confidence, driven by factors like strong SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) contributions and the ongoing search for stability in large-cap stocks. Several large-cap funds have also outperformed their benchmarks over the past five years. Performance overview Below are the large-cap mutual funds that have outperformed their respective benchmarks over the last five years: Fund Name 5-Year Return (%) Benchmark Benchmark 5-Year Return (%) Nippon India Large Cap Fund 19.75 BSE 100 Total Return Index 17.47 ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund 19.09 NIFTY 100 Total Return Index 16.68 JM Large Cap Fund 18.07 BSE 100 Total Return Index 17.47 Canara Robeco Bluechip Equity Fund 17.68 BSE 100 Total Return Index 17.47 Invesco India Largecap Fund 17.75 NIFTY 100 Total Return Index 16.68 Tata Large Cap Fund 16.13 NIFTY 100 Total Return Index 16.68 SBI Bluechip Fund 16.47 BSE 100 Total Return Index 17.47 HDFC Top 100 Fund 17.28 NIFTY 100 Total Return Index 16.68 Kotak Bluechip Fund 17.24 NIFTY 100 Total Return Index 16.68 Bandhan Large Cap Fund 17.11 BSE 100 Total Return Index 17.47 (Source: AMFI data as of November 12) According to Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director at Morningstar Investment Research India, the strong performance of large-cap funds reflects the growing preference for stability in uncertain times. \"The renewed interest in large-cap funds is a result of their favourable valuation in the current market scenario. This shift toward large-cap investing also suggests that investors are diversifying their portfolios to avoid missing out on attractive opportunities across market segments,\" Srivastava said.

Aim to get tickets to the latest concerts, explore the depths of the ocean, or aim to\\r                 become the proud owner of a supercar - aim to start achieving all your dreams by\\r                 investing with an SIP. Start small and stay consistent, with SIPs in Mutual Funds that\\r                 suit your risk appetite and aim to meet your financial goals. Before you shoot your shot with Mutual Funds Here are a few things you should know: What is an SIP? An SIP or Systematic Investment Plan is a medium of investing a fixed\\r                         amount\\r                         at regular intervals in Mutual Funds, to meet different investment goals\\r                         from travel, to shopping, to buying your first vehicle. With the flexibility of investment monthly, quarterly, half-yearly,\\r                         etc.\\r                         the investor need not invest a lump-sum amount all at once, and hence\\r                         reduces the burden of a large investment, while helping cultivate the\\r                         habit\\r                         of small, consistent savings for the long-term. Today, you can start with as little as Rs. 100* and invest as per your\\r                         convenience or set up standing instructions with the bank to debit the\\r                         amount from your account, regularly. *Subject to minimum amount prescribed in Scheme Information Document of\\r                         respective scheme. What are the benefits of SIP? SIPs are gaining popularity as one of the favourable investment\\r                         modesthat\\r                         may help peoplemeet their financial goals. Here are the benefits you\\r                         can\\r                         enjoy with SIP: - Power of Compounding: SIP works on the principle of\\r                         compounding, which means, when you invest a small amount of money over a\\r                         period of time, you may be able to grow your wealth by earning interest\\r                         on\\r                         interest, allowing you to meet your financial goals. - Ease of investing: Getting started with an SIP is so simple!\\r                         With just Rs. 100*, you can grow your small investment into wealth over\\r                         a\\r                         period of time. Track, modify, stop or give standing instructions to the\\r                         bank no wonder more and more investors are getting on board Systematic\\r                         Investment Plans! -Rupee Cost Averaging: This concept works on the idea where you buy more units when the', 'images': [], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INDA/', 'content': '[no text]', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/mutual-funds/performance-tracker/navs/index-fundsetfs.html', 'content': 'Nav Details - index funds/etfs,index fundsetfs fund Performance Tracker | Mutual funds with highest returns - Moneycontrol.com English Hindi Gujarati Specials Search Quotes, News, Mutual Fund NAVs Trending Stocks Brightcom Group INE425B01027, BCG, 532368 NSDL INE301O01023, , 544467 Suzlon Energy INE040H01021, SUZLON, 532667 Ola Electric INE0LXG01040, OLAELEC, 544225 TCS INE467B01029, TCS, 532540 Quotes Mutual Funds Commodities Futures & Options Currency News Cryptocurrency Forum Notices Videos Glossary All Hello, Login Hello, Login Log-in or Sign-Up My Account My Profile My Portfolio My Watchlist My Alerts My Messages Price Alerts My Profile My PRO My Portfolio My Watchlist My Alerts My Messages Price Alerts Logout Loans up to 50 LAKHS Fixed Deposits Credit Cards Lifetime Free Credit Score Chat with Us Download App Follow us on: Go Ad-Free My Alerts mcmfinternal->Moneycontrol/MC_MF/MC_MF_Internal_728x90|~|Moneycontrol/MC_MF/MC_MF_Internal_300x250|~|Moneycontrol/MC_MF/MC_MF_Internal_160x600_Networth|~|Moneycontrol/MC_MF/MC_MF_Internal_300x250_Networth|~|Moneycontrol/MC_MF/MC_MF_Internal_MFMeter_728x90_2|~|Moneycontrol/MC_MF/MC_MF_Internal_468x60|~|Moneycontrol/MC_MF/MC_MF_Internal_MFMeter_300x600|~|Moneycontrol/MC_MF/MC_MF_Internal_MFMeter_728x90_4|~|Moneycontrol/MC_MF/MC_MF_NEW_ROS_300x600|~|Moneycontrol/MC_MF/MC_MF_Internal_Native_ATF_640x60|~|Moneycontrol/MC_MF/MC_MF_INTERNAL_SIP_300x80-> Go PRO Now PRO PRO Markets HOME INDIAN INDICES STOCK ACTION All Stats Top Gainers Top Losers Only Buyers Only Sellers 52 Week High 52 Week Low Price Shockers Volume Shockers Most Active Stocks GLOBAL MARKETS ETFs US MARKETS UNLISTED SHARES STOCK SCANNER Fundamental Scanner Technical Scanner ECONOMIC INDICATORS ECONOMIC CALENDAR MARKET ACTION F&O FII & DII Activity Corporate Action EARNINGS DEALS Bulk Deals Block Deals Intraday Large Deals SECTOR ANALYSIS PRE MARKET SEASONALITY ANALYSIS RESEARCH Investment Advice Technicals COMMODITY CURRENCY CRYPTOCURRENCY TECHNICAL TRENDS IPO BONDS WEBINAR SWING TRADING MASTERCLASS MC LEARN TRADERS CONCLAVE INTERVIEW SERIES OTHERS Cryptocurrency News Tools News LATEST NEWS Assembly Elections BUSINESS Economy Companies Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startup Real Estate Bank Holidays 2025 Banking NATION & WORLD India City World Politics MARKETS Stocks Technical Analysis Equity Research Commodities Currency Gold Rate Silver Rate AQI SPECIAL Trends Opinion Explainers MC Buzz MC Features MC Learn TECHNOLOGY Personal Tech Auto Fintech MEDIA Podcast Photos Videos Web Stories CRYPTO DASHBOARD PETROL PRICE IN INDIA DIESEL PRICE IN INDIA MONSOON TRACKER OTHERS Entertainment Sports Lifestyle Health and Fitness Education Jobs Science Astro Religion Travel Editors Picks Tech India Learning Curve Portfolio Watchlist Commodities MF EXPLORE Home Find Fund Top Ranked Funds Performance Tracker SIP Performance Tracker ETFs NFO Top Performing Categories Learn TOOLS Returns Calculator Lumpsum SIP Balancer Delay Cost Calculator MF FORUM TRACK Your MF Investment MF Prices Personal Finance EXPLORE Home Investing Insurance Banking Financial Planning Property Tools Video Ask Expert Explainer NPS FIXED DEPOSIT FDs @ 8.4% p.a.

What is average maturity and how is it useful? Why is it essential to match the investment horizon with that of the scheme? A debt fund is a mutual fund scheme that invests in fixed income instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds, corporate debt securities, and money market instruments etc. that offer capital appreciation. Debt funds are also referred to as Income Funds or Bond Funds. Debt funds are ideal for investors who want regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Term Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt mutual funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve your financial goals in a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns. Debt funds invest in either listed or unlisted debt instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds at a certain price and later sell them at a margin. The difference between the cost and sale price accounts for the appreciation or depreciation in the funds net asset value (NAV). Debt funds also receive periodic interest from the underlying debt instruments in which they invest. In terms                   of return, debt funds that earn regular interest from the fixed income instruments during the funds tenure are similar to bank fixed deposits that earn interest. This interest income gets added to a debt fund on a                   daily basis. If the interest payment is received, say, once every year, it is divided by 365 and the debt funds NAV goes up daily by this small amount. Thus, a debt schemes NAV also depends on the interest rates of                   its underlying assets and also on any upgrade or downgrade in the credit rating of its holdings. Market prices of debt securities change with movements in interest rates. Lets assume, your debt fund owns a security that yields 10 % interest. If the interest rate in the economy falls, new instruments issued in the                   market would offer this lower rate. To match this lower rate, there would be an increase in the prices your funds underlying instruments as they have a higher coupon (intere', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/personal-finance/debt-mutual-funds-february-amfi-data-outflows-factors-liquid-short-term-schemes-19572577.htm', 'content': 'Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February - CNBC TV18 Join Us Log in / Sign up Become a Member Language English Latest news Live Updates Markets Business Personal Finance Economy India World Upcoming Events Engage with CNBC-TV18 Photos Videos Minis Web Stories Polls Quiz Healthcare Politics Travel Education & Careers Sports Views Auto Entertainment Technology Startups Lifestyle Retail Real Estate Minis Special Coverage India Business Leader Awards Branded Content HealthX Elevate India Retirement Insights Summit The Growth Summit Ceo awards Accelerate Your Cloud Journey Accelerating to a Connected Future Financial Services Cloud Symposium Crypto Education Next Ey Entrepreneur Of The Year IRMA Wizards of finance The Thought League Discover CNBCTV18 About Contact Advertise Disclaimer Terms of Use Privacy Policy Shows Anchors Polls 11:11 Newsletter Life Watch Live TV Latest News New #HealthXElevate New #NavigateWithHSBC #NiveshKaSahiKadam New SME Champions Season 2 Home Personal Finance News Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. By Anshul March 12, 2025, 2:07:44 PM IST (Published) 2 Min Read Debt mutual funds witnessed net outflows of 6,525.56 crore in February 2025, reversing from strong inflows of 1,28,652.58 crore in January. Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. Category-wise performance Outflows: Ultra-short duration funds: 4,281.02 crore Overnight funds and low-duration funds: 2,263.94 crore Money market funds: 275.96 crore Inflows: Liquid funds: 4,976.97 crore Corporate bond funds: 1,064.83 crore Short-duration funds: 473.53 crore Reasons behind the outflows Nehal Meshram, Senior Analyst Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, attributed the redemptions to investors rebalancing portfolios. \"10 out of 16 debt fund categories saw outflows, primarily in short-duration funds. These accounted for 90% of total redemptions,\" Meshram said. She noted that some investors may be shifting to longer-duration bonds in anticipation of interest rate cuts by the RBI. \"Medium to long duration and gilt funds saw marginal inflows, reflecting investor positioning for potential capital appreciation. Gilt funds remain attractive due to their low credit risk and sovereign backing,\" she added. Market outlook Debt fund flows may stabilize as market conditions evolve. Interest rate movements and inflation trends will be key factors influencing investor sentiment in the coming months. Other category performance On the other hand, New fund offers (NFOs) collected 4,029 crore, compared to 4,544 crore in the previous month. Gold ETFs recorded inflows of 1,980 crore, down from 3,751.4 crore. Sectoral and thematic funds saw inflows of 5,711.6 crore, lower than 9,016.6 crore in January.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The task is to create a configuration object to provide downstream calculations, namely the SIP calculation. We will focus on extracting all the required data to build the allocation and context. \n\n**SIP Context Configuration**:\nThe risk appetite is 'High', mapping to 12% annual return (from T001 original query), so we set annual_return_pct = 12 and monthly_return_r = 0.01. The default inflation rate is 5.5%, and is not overridden.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"annual_return_pct\": 12,\n  \"monthly_return_r\": 0.01,\n  \"inflation_pct\": 5.5,\n  \"formula_notes\": \"SIP = FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV_inflated = FV*(1+i)^years\"\n}\n```\n\n**Allocation Plan JSON**:\nThe equity/debt split needs to follow the 'High' risk appetite, which is 70% equity and 30% debt.\nFrom the fund shortlist (T012), we identify relevant equity and debt categories. Based on the available data, the 'recommended_fund_categories' will include Large Cap, Flexi Cap, Midcap, and Small Cap funds for equity, and no specific recommendation for debt, as the dataset doesn't yet include debt funds.  ELSS is kept optional in the allocation_plan.\nRationale: \n- The risk appetite is 'High' per the T001 input.\n- Equity: 70% allocation to equity funds as per the 'High' risk appetite.\n    - Large Cap: Suitable for stable returns.\n    - Flexi Cap: Offers flexibility to invest across market caps.\n    - Mid Cap: Offers high growth potential.\n    - Small Cap: Offers very high growth potential, but also high risk.\n- Debt: 30% allocation to debt funds as per the 'High' risk appetite. No specific recommendation as the debt funds are yet to be analyzed.\n- ELSS: The 'elss_optional' flag is set to true as the user did not specify any tax saving requirements.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"equity_percent\": 70,\n  \"debt_percent\": 30,\n  \"recommended_fund_categories\": {\n    \"equity\": [\"Large Cap\", \"Flexi Cap\", \"Midcap\", \"Small Cap\"],\n    \"debt\": [],\n    \"elss_optional\": true\n  },\n  \"notes\": {\n    \"very_low\": \"Very Low policy → Extremely conservative, e.g., 90% debt / 10% equity\",\n    \"low\": \"Low policy → Conservative, e.g., 70% debt / 30% equity\",\n    \"low_moderate\": \"Low-Moderate policy → Tilted conservative, e.g., 60% debt / 40% equity\",\n    \"moderate\": \"Moderate policy → Balanced mix, e.g., 50% equity / 50% debt\",\n    \"high_moderate\": \"High-Moderate policy → Tilted aggressive, e.g., 60% equity / 40% debt\",\n    \"high\": \"High policy → Aggressive, e.g., 70% equity / 30% debt\",\n    \"very_high\": \"Very High policy → Extremely aggressive, e.g., 90% equity / 10% debt\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the fund recommendations aligns with the individual's risk profile.

What is average maturity and how is it useful? Why is it essential to match the investment horizon with that of the scheme? A debt fund is a mutual fund scheme that invests in fixed income instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds, corporate debt securities, and money market instruments etc. that offer capital appreciation. Debt funds are also referred to as Income Funds or Bond Funds. Debt funds are ideal for investors who want regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Term Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt mutual funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve your financial goals in a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns. Debt funds invest in either listed or unlisted debt instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds at a certain price and later sell them at a margin. The difference between the cost and sale price accounts for the appreciation or depreciation in the funds net asset value (NAV). Debt funds also receive periodic interest from the underlying debt instruments in which they invest. In terms                   of return, debt funds that earn regular interest from the fixed income instruments during the funds tenure are similar to bank fixed deposits that earn interest. This interest income gets added to a debt fund on a                   daily basis. If the interest payment is received, say, once every year, it is divided by 365 and the debt funds NAV goes up daily by this small amount. Thus, a debt schemes NAV also depends on the interest rates of                   its underlying assets and also on any upgrade or downgrade in the credit rating of its holdings. Market prices of debt securities change with movements in interest rates. Lets assume, your debt fund owns a security that yields 10 % interest. If the interest rate in the economy falls, new instruments issued in the                   market would offer this lower rate. To match this lower rate, there would be an increase in the prices your funds underlying instruments as they have a higher coupon (intere', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/personal-finance/debt-mutual-funds-february-amfi-data-outflows-factors-liquid-short-term-schemes-19572577.htm', 'content': 'Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February - CNBC TV18 Join Us Log in / Sign up Become a Member Language English Latest news Live Updates Markets Business Personal Finance Economy India World Upcoming Events Engage with CNBC-TV18 Photos Videos Minis Web Stories Polls Quiz Healthcare Politics Travel Education & Careers Sports Views Auto Entertainment Technology Startups Lifestyle Retail Real Estate Minis Special Coverage India Business Leader Awards Branded Content HealthX Elevate India Retirement Insights Summit The Growth Summit Ceo awards Accelerate Your Cloud Journey Accelerating to a Connected Future Financial Services Cloud Symposium Crypto Education Next Ey Entrepreneur Of The Year IRMA Wizards of finance The Thought League Discover CNBCTV18 About Contact Advertise Disclaimer Terms of Use Privacy Policy Shows Anchors Polls 11:11 Newsletter Life Watch Live TV Latest News New #HealthXElevate New #NavigateWithHSBC #NiveshKaSahiKadam New SME Champions Season 2 Home Personal Finance News Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Investors pull out 6,526 crore from debt funds in February Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. By Anshul March 12, 2025, 2:07:44 PM IST (Published) 2 Min Read Debt mutual funds witnessed net outflows of 6,525.56 crore in February 2025, reversing from strong inflows of 1,28,652.58 crore in January. Short-duration funds saw the highest redemptions, while liquid funds recorded the most inflows. Category-wise performance Outflows: Ultra-short duration funds: 4,281.02 crore Overnight funds and low-duration funds: 2,263.94 crore Money market funds: 275.96 crore Inflows: Liquid funds: 4,976.97 crore Corporate bond funds: 1,064.83 crore Short-duration funds: 473.53 crore Reasons behind the outflows Nehal Meshram, Senior Analyst Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, attributed the redemptions to investors rebalancing portfolios. \"10 out of 16 debt fund categories saw outflows, primarily in short-duration funds. These accounted for 90% of total redemptions,\" Meshram said. She noted that some investors may be shifting to longer-duration bonds in anticipation of interest rate cuts by the RBI. \"Medium to long duration and gilt funds saw marginal inflows, reflecting investor positioning for potential capital appreciation. Gilt funds remain attractive due to their low credit risk and sovereign backing,\" she added. Market outlook Debt fund flows may stabilize as market conditions evolve. Interest rate movements and inflation trends will be key factors influencing investor sentiment in the coming months. Other category performance On the other hand, New fund offers (NFOs) collected 4,029 crore, compared to 4,544 crore in the previous month. Gold ETFs recorded inflows of 1,980 crore, down from 3,751.4 crore. Sectoral and thematic funds saw inflows of 5,711.6 crore, lower than 9,016.6 crore in January.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The task is to create a configuration object to provide downstream calculations, namely the SIP calculation. We will focus on extracting all the required data to build the allocation and context. \n\n**SIP Context Configuration**:\nThe risk appetite is 'High', mapping to 12% annual return (from T001 original query), so we set annual_return_pct = 12 and monthly_return_r = 0.01. The default inflation rate is 5.5%, and is not overridden.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"annual_return_pct\": 12,\n  \"monthly_return_r\": 0.01,\n  \"inflation_pct\": 5.5,\n  \"formula_notes\": \"SIP = FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV_inflated = FV*(1+i)^years\"\n}\n```\n\n**Allocation Plan JSON**:\nThe equity/debt split needs to follow the 'High' risk appetite, which is 70% equity and 30% debt.\nFrom the fund shortlist (T012), we identify relevant equity and debt categories. Based on the available data, the 'recommended_fund_categories' will include Large Cap, Flexi Cap, Midcap, and Small Cap funds for equity, and no specific recommendation for debt, as the dataset doesn't yet include debt funds.  ELSS is kept optional in the allocation_plan.\nRationale: \n- The risk appetite is 'High' per the T001 input.\n- Equity: 70% allocation to equity funds as per the 'High' risk appetite.\n    - Large Cap: Suitable for stable returns.\n    - Flexi Cap: Offers flexibility to invest across market caps.\n    - Mid Cap: Offers high growth potential.\n    - Small Cap: Offers very high growth potential, but also high risk.\n- Debt: 30% allocation to debt funds as per the 'High' risk appetite. No specific recommendation as the debt funds are yet to be analyzed.\n- ELSS: The 'elss_optional' flag is set to true as the user did not specify any tax saving requirements.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"equity_percent\": 70,\n  \"debt_percent\": 30,\n  \"recommended_fund_categories\": {\n    \"equity\": [\"Large Cap\", \"Flexi Cap\", \"Midcap\", \"Small Cap\"],\n    \"debt\": [],\n    \"elss_optional\": true\n  },\n  \"notes\": {\n    \"very_low\": \"Very Low policy → Extremely conservative, e.g., 90% debt / 10% equity\",\n    \"low\": \"Low policy → Conservative, e.g., 70% debt / 30% equity\",\n    \"low_moderate\": \"Low-Moderate policy → Tilted conservative, e.g., 60% debt / 40% equity\",\n    \"moderate\": \"Moderate policy → Balanced mix, e.g., 50% equity / 50% debt\",\n    \"high_moderate\": \"High-Moderate policy → Tilted aggressive, e.g., 60% equity / 40% debt\",\n    \"high\": \"High policy → Aggressive, e.g., 70% equity / 30% debt\",\n    \"very_high\": \"Very High policy → Extremely aggressive, e.g., 90% equity / 10% debt\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the fund recommendations aligns with the individual's risk profile.
