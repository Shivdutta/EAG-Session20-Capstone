It can create 30000 word code, am I still calling it multiple times? \n- [x] Never use simple or shortcut words like simple, easy, quick, etc. Use words like exhaustive, detailed, comprehensive, etc.\n- [x] For website creation task am I not creating initial theme, structure, before making individual Pages?

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the user's high-risk appetite, the asset allocation has been adjusted to 80% equity and 20% debt, aligning with the provided guidelines (High policy → Aggressive, e.g., 80% equity / 20% debt). The initial allocation from the previous step was 70/30, which is less aggressive than recommended for a high-risk appetite. \n\nFurthermore, the search for Large Cap equity funds returned no results (as per T012). Consequently, Large Cap funds are not included in the recommended equity allocation.  To compensate for the absence of Large Cap funds, investors may consider increasing exposure to Mid Cap and Small Cap funds, or include Multi-Cap funds to achieve a diversified equity portfolio. \n\nThe debt portion is allocated to Short Term Debt and Long Term Debt funds. The specific allocation within debt funds should be determined based on interest rate outlook and liquidity requirements.\n\nIt is crucial to periodically review this asset allocation to ensure it continues to align with the investor's risk tolerance and investment goals. Market conditions and changes in the investor's financial situation may warrant adjustments to the asset allocation.\n\nFormula notes: SIP = FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV_inflated = FV*(1+i)^years, where FV is the future value, r is the monthly return rate, n is the number of months, and i is the inflation rate.",

Market fluctuations, economic downturns, and changes in interest rates can impact investment returns. The absence of Large Cap funds may increase the overall risk profile of the equity portion, potentially leading to higher volatility. Inflation can erode the purchasing power of returns, and unexpected expenses or changes in financial circumstances can affect the ability to maintain the SIP. It is essential to regularly monitor the investment portfolio, review the asset allocation, and adjust the SIP amount as needed to mitigate these risks and uncertainties. Diversification across different asset classes and fund categories can help reduce the impact of market volatility. Consulting with a qualified financial advisor is recommended to develop a personalized investment strategy that aligns with individual risk tolerance and financial goals. Unexpected global events and regulatory changes can also introduce uncertainties and affect investment outcomes. Moreover, the projected returns are based on historical data and assumptions, and future performance may differ significantly.</p></section><section id='data-sources'><h2>Data Sources</h2><ul><li>T001: SIP Goal Planner Agent Output</li><li>T013: SIP Goal Planner Agent Output (Revised Asset Allocation)</li><li>T015: Chart Data and Embed Snippet</li><li>T014: Validation Results</li></ul></section><section id='appendix'><h2>Appendix</h2><p><b>SIP Formula:</b> FV = P * (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r), where FV is the future value, P is the monthly SIP amount, r is the monthly return rate, and n is the number of months.</p><p><b>Inflation Adjustment Formula:</b> FV_inflated = FV * (1 + i)^years, where FV is the future value, i is the inflation rate, and years is the number of years.</p></section><section id='disclaimer'><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This report is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Market fluctuations, economic downturns, and changes in interest rates can impact investment returns. The absence of Large Cap funds may increase the overall risk profile of the equity portion, potentially leading to higher volatility. Inflation can erode the purchasing power of returns, and unexpected expenses or changes in financial circumstances can affect the ability to maintain the SIP. It is essential to regularly monitor the investment portfolio, review the asset allocation, and adjust the SIP amount as needed to mitigate these risks and uncertainties. Diversification across different asset classes and fund categories can help reduce the impact of market volatility. Consulting with a qualified financial advisor is recommended to develop a personalized investment strategy that aligns with individual risk tolerance and financial goals. Unexpected global events and regulatory changes can also introduce uncertainties and affect investment outcomes. Moreover, the projected returns are based on historical data and assumptions, and future performance may differ significantly. Consider consulting with a financial advisor.</p>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"validation-summary\" class=\"bg-white shadow rounded-2xl p-6 mb-6\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-3\">Validation Summary</h2>\n            <div id=\"validation-summary-content\"></div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"charts\" class=\"mb-6\">\n            <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-8\">\n                <div class=\"bg-white shadow rounded-2xl p-4\">\n                    <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-3\">SIP Projection Chart</h3>\n                    <canvas id=\"sipProjectionChart\"></canvas>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"bg-white shadow rounded-2xl p-4\">\n                    <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-3\">Asset Allocation Chart</h3>\n                    <canvas id=\"sipAllocationChart\"></canvas>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"disclaimer\" class=\"bg-white shadow rounded-2xl p-6 mb-6\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-3\">Disclaimer</h2>\n            <p>This report is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

It can create 30000 word code, am I still calling it multiple times? \n- [x] Never use simple or shortcut words like simple, easy, quick, etc. Use words like exhaustive, detailed, comprehensive, etc.\n- [x] For website creation task am I not creating initial theme, structure, before making individual Pages? Will that not make CoderAgents to work in isolation, each creating its own file/theme/font/css! I should first make a CoderAgent to focus on theme, design, structure, and then send its outputs as inputs to all coderAgents. \n- [x] Am I called DistillerAgent or FormatterAgent after website creation task!

The initial allocation from the previous step was 70/30, which is less aggressive than recommended for a high-risk appetite. \n\nFurthermore, the search for Large Cap equity funds returned no results (as per T012). Consequently, Large Cap funds are not included in the recommended equity allocation.  To compensate for the absence of Large Cap funds, investors may consider increasing exposure to Mid Cap and Small Cap funds, or include Multi-Cap funds to achieve a diversified equity portfolio. \n\nThe debt portion is allocated to Short Term Debt and Long Term Debt funds. The specific allocation within debt funds should be determined based on interest rate outlook and liquidity requirements.\n\nIt is crucial to periodically review this asset allocation to ensure it continues to align with the investor's risk tolerance and investment goals. Market conditions and changes in the investor's financial situation may warrant adjustments to the asset allocation.\n\nFormula notes: SIP = FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV_inflated = FV*(1+i)^years, where FV is the future value, r is the monthly return rate, n is the number of months, and i is the inflation rate.",
