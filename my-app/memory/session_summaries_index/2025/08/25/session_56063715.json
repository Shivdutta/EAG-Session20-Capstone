Now, I need to assemble the rest of the SIP execution chain as per the instructions: retrieval, distillation, Q&A, charts, and report. I'll use the outputs from T001 as inputs to the subsequent tasks. I need to pay careful attention to the schemas and the data dependencies to ensure the agents have the necessary information to complete their tasks.  I will create RetrieverAgent, DistillerAgent, ThinkerAgent, QAAgent, CoderAgent, FormatterAgent, ReportGeneratorAgent and SchedulerAgent and create dependencies between them and also include data from T001.",

All agents are state-less and I will provide the context needed for each agent to operate correctly.  I have provided the necessary inputs to all agents, especially the CoderAgent.  All output file names are specified. The plan will run in parallel if all dependencies are completed, with appropriate dependencies for CoderAgent. The plan seems granular and detailed enough for consulting/programming quality. CoderAgent will handle code generation and execution in a single atomic step.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The primary goal is to provide a suitable asset allocation plan for a user with a high-risk appetite, aiming for a retirement corpus of INR 51,266,855.7 in 10 years, requiring a monthly SIP of INR 240,416.85. The previous allocation plan (T001) recommended a 70/30 equity/debt split. Given the high-risk appetite and the fund shortlist from T012, I will adjust the allocation plan. The funds identified in T012 are a mix of aggressive hybrid funds, large cap funds, mid-cap funds, small-cap funds, and flexi-cap funds.\n\nGiven the 'High' risk appetite, I will adjust the allocation slightly towards a more aggressive portfolio, opting for an 80/20 split. This aligns with the provided scale where 'High' corresponds to 70/30 and the 'Very High' corresponds to 90/10. Since the list of funds includes small cap, an 80% allocation to equity is reasonable given the investor's high-risk appetite. It is important to note that small cap funds are subject to high volatility. The annual return is therefore configured as 12%. The rationale is that a higher equity allocation is justified by the availability of small-cap and mid-cap funds, and the user's stated high-risk tolerance.\n\nAllocation Rationale:\n*   Equity (80%): The fund shortlist contains several equity-oriented funds across different market capitalizations (large, mid, small, flexi). The investor's high-risk appetite warrants a significant allocation to equity for potentially higher returns. This includes funds like Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund, HDFC Flexi Cap Fund, Axis Midcap Fund, Kotak Emerging Equity Fund, Axis Small Cap Fund, SBI Small Cap Fund, Canara Robeco Bluechip Equity Fund, Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund. The flexi-cap allocation gives a manager leeway to adjust market cap allocation.\n*   Debt (20%): While the investor has a high-risk appetite, a small allocation to debt can provide some stability and diversification. The fund shortlist does not explicitly list debt funds, but aggressive hybrid funds like SBI Equity Hybrid Fund and Mirae Asset Hybrid Equity Fund, which invest 20-35% in debt, can be considered for this portion.\n\n\nSIP Configuration:\n*   annual_return_pct: 12 (Based on 'High' risk appetite)\n*   monthly_return_r: 0.01 (annual_return_pct / 12 / 100)\n*   inflation_pct: 5.5 (Default value, can be overridden)\n*   formula_notes: SIP = FV\\*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV_inflated = FV\\*(1+i)^years",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The primary goal is to provide a suitable asset allocation plan for a user with a high-risk appetite, aiming for a retirement corpus of INR 51,266,855.7 in 10 years, requiring a monthly SIP of INR 240,416.85. The previous allocation plan (T001) recommended a 70/30 equity/debt split. Given the high-risk appetite and the fund shortlist from T012, I will adjust the allocation plan. The funds identified in T012 are a mix of aggressive hybrid funds, large cap funds, mid-cap funds, small-cap funds, and flexi-cap funds.\n\nGiven the 'High' risk appetite, I will adjust the allocation slightly towards a more aggressive portfolio, opting for an 80/20 split. This aligns with the provided scale where 'High' corresponds to 70/30 and the 'Very High' corresponds to 90/10. Since the list of funds includes small cap, an 80% allocation to equity is reasonable given the investor's high-risk appetite. It is important to note that small cap funds are subject to high volatility. The annual return is therefore configured as 12%. The rationale is that a higher equity allocation is justified by the availability of small-cap and mid-cap funds, and the user's stated high-risk tolerance.\n\nAllocation Rationale:\n*   Equity (80%): The fund shortlist contains several equity-oriented funds across different market capitalizations (large, mid, small, flexi). The investor's high-risk appetite warrants a significant allocation to equity for potentially higher returns. This includes funds like Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund, HDFC Flexi Cap Fund, Axis Midcap Fund, Kotak Emerging Equity Fund, Axis Small Cap Fund, SBI Small Cap Fund, Canara Robeco Bluechip Equity Fund, Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund. The flexi-cap allocation gives a manager leeway to adjust market cap allocation.\n*   Debt (20%): While the investor has a high-risk appetite, a small allocation to debt can provide some stability and diversification. The fund shortlist does not explicitly list debt funds, but aggressive hybrid funds like SBI Equity Hybrid Fund and Mirae Asset Hybrid Equity Fund, which invest 20-35% in debt, can be considered for this portion.\n\n\nSIP Configuration:\n*   annual_return_pct: 12 (Based on 'High' risk appetite)\n*   monthly_return_r: 0.01 (annual_return_pct / 12 / 100)\n*   inflation_pct: 5.5 (Default value, can be overridden)\n*   formula_notes: SIP = FV\\*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV_inflated = FV\\*(1+i)^years",
