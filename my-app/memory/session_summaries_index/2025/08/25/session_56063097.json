Now, as PlannerAgent, I need to create the rest of the SIP execution chain.

The goal is to provide a user-friendly overview of the SIP plan and recommended fund categories based on the user's risk appetite and goals.I have to create a plan to: \n1.

In the Indian context, as per current SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations, an equity mutual fund scheme must invest at least 65% of the schemes assets in equities and equity related instruments. An Equity Fund can be actively managed or passively managed. Index funds and ETFs are passively managed. Equity mutual funds are principally categorized according to company size, the investment style of the holdings in the portfolio and geography. The size of an equity fund is determined by a market capitalization, while the investment style, reflected in the fund's stock holdings, is also used to categorize equity mutual funds. Equity funds are also categorized by whether they are domestic (investing in stocks of only Indian companies) or international (investing in stocks of overseas companies). These can be broad market, regional or single-country funds. Some specialty equity funds target business sectors, such as health care, commodities and real estate and are known as Sectoral Funds. Ideal Investment Vehicle In many ways, equity funds are ideal investment vehicles for investors that are not as well-versed in financial investing or do not possess a large amount of capital with which to invest. Equity funds are practical investments for most people. The attributes that make equity funds most suitable for small individual investors are the reduction of risk resulting from a fund's portfolio diversification and the relatively small amount of capital required to acquire shares of an equity fund. A large amount of investment capital would be required for an individual investor to achieve a similar degree of risk reduction through diversification of a portfolio of direct stock holdings. Pooling small investors' capital allows an equity fund to diversify effectively without burdening each investor with large capital requirements. The price of the equity fund is based on the fund's net asset value (NAV) less its liabilities. A more diversified fund means that there is less negative effect of an individual stock's adverse price movement on the overall portfolio and on the share price of the equity fund. Equity funds are managed by experienced professional portfolio managers, and their past performance is a matter of public record. Transparency and reporting requirements for equity funds are heavily regulated by the federal government. A Fund for Everyone Equity funds are very popular amongst the retail investors among various categories of mutual fund products.

What is average maturity and how is it useful? Why is it essential to match the investment horizon with that of the scheme? A debt fund is a mutual fund scheme that invests in fixed income instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds, corporate debt securities, and money market instruments etc. that offer capital appreciation. Debt funds are also referred to as Income Funds or Bond Funds. Debt funds are ideal for investors who want regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Term Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt mutual funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve your financial goals in a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns. Debt funds invest in either listed or unlisted debt instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds at a certain price and later sell them at a margin. The difference between the cost and sale price accounts for the appreciation or depreciation in the funds net asset value (NAV). Debt funds also receive periodic interest from the underlying debt instruments in which they invest. In terms                   of return, debt funds that earn regular interest from the fixed income instruments during the funds tenure are similar to bank fixed deposits that earn interest. This interest income gets added to a debt fund on a                   daily basis. If the interest payment is received, say, once every year, it is divided by 365 and the debt funds NAV goes up daily by this small amount. Thus, a debt schemes NAV also depends on the interest rates of                   its underlying assets and also on any upgrade or downgrade in the credit rating of its holdings. Market prices of debt securities change with movements in interest rates. Lets assume, your debt fund owns a security that yields 10 % interest. If the interest rate in the economy falls, new instruments issued in the                   market would offer this lower rate. To match this lower rate, there would be an increase in the prices your funds underlying instruments as they have a higher coupon (intere', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://www.fundsindia.com/c/Debt-Short-Duration-Fund/16', 'content': \"Debt - Best Debt - Short Duration Funds | List of Top performing Debt - Short Duration Mutual Funds Services Mutual Fund Advice FundsIndia Select Funds Tools Funds Explorer Calculators Join for free Sign in Capital Protection Debt - Banking and PSU Fund Debt - Corporate Bond Fund Debt - Credit Risk Fund Debt - Dynamic Bond Debt - Floater Fund Debt - Gilt Fund Debt - Gilt Fund with 10 year constant duration Debt - Index Fund Debt - Infrastructure Debt - Liquid Fund Debt - Long Duration Fund Debt - Low Duration Fund Debt - Medium Duration Fund Debt - Medium to Long Duration Fund Debt - Money Market Fund Debt - Overnight Fund Debt - Short Duration Fund Debt - Ultra Short Duration Fund Debt -Interval Funds - Half Yearly Debt -Interval Funds - Monthly Debt -Interval Funds - Quarterly Debt -Interval Funds - Yearly Equity - Contra Fund Equity - Dividend Yield Fund Equity - ELSS Equity - Flexi Cap Fund Equity - Focused Fund Equity - Large & Mid Cap Fund Equity - Large Cap Fund Equity - Mid Cap Fund Equity - Multi Cap Fund Equity - Sectoral Fund - Auto Equity - Sectoral Fund - Banks & Financial Services Equity - Sectoral Fund - Consumption Equity - Sectoral Fund - Energy & Power Equity - Sectoral Fund - Infrastructure Equity - Sectoral Fund - Media & Entertainment Equity - Sectoral Fund - Pharma & Health Care Equity - Sectoral Fund - Service Industry Equity - Sectoral Fund - Technology Equity - Small cap Fund Equity - Thematic Fund - Global Equity - Thematic Fund - MNC Equity - Thematic Fund - Other Equity - Value Fund ETFs - Debt ETFs - Gold ETFs - Index ETFs - Other ETFs - Silver Fixed Maturity Plans FoFs (Domestic / Overseas ) - Gold FoFs (Domestic) - Debt Oriented FoFs (Domestic) - Equity Oriented FoFs (Domestic) - Hybrid FoFs (Domestic) - Silver FoFs (Overseas) Hybrid - Aggressive Hybrid Fund Hybrid - Arbitrage Fund Hybrid - Balanced Advantage Hybrid - Balanced Hybrid Fund Hybrid - Conservative Hybrid Fund Hybrid - Dynamic Asset Allocation Hybrid - Equity Savings Hybrid - Multi Asset Allocation Index Funds - Nifty Index Funds - Nifty Next 50 Index Funds - Other Index Funds - Sensex Real Estate Solution Oriented - Children's Fund Solution Oriented - Retirement Fund - Debt Solution Oriented - Retirement Fund - Equity List of Debt - Short Duration Fund Funds 62 schemes found.

Given the 'High' risk appetite specified in T001's 'goal_input_json', and the policy defined in the prompt (High → 80/20 equity/debt), I will adjust the allocation to 80% equity and 20% debt. This aligns better with a 'High' risk profile, seeking potentially higher returns with increased volatility. The 'fund_shortlist' from T012 provides a variety of equity fund categories, including Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap, which are suitable for the equity portion of the portfolio. For the debt portion, 'Short Duration Debt' funds are readily available, making them a practical choice. The ELSS option is retained as optional, as it aligns with tax-saving goals but isn't mandatory. The rationale behind this allocation is to maximize potential returns given the high-risk tolerance while ensuring diversification across equity categories and including a debt component for stability.  I also generated the config object for downstream math, mapping the 'High' risk appetite to a 12% annual return.",

In the Indian context, as per current SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations, an equity mutual fund scheme must invest at least 65% of the schemes assets in equities and equity related instruments. An Equity Fund can be actively managed or passively managed. Index funds and ETFs are passively managed. Equity mutual funds are principally categorized according to company size, the investment style of the holdings in the portfolio and geography. The size of an equity fund is determined by a market capitalization, while the investment style, reflected in the fund's stock holdings, is also used to categorize equity mutual funds. Equity funds are also categorized by whether they are domestic (investing in stocks of only Indian companies) or international (investing in stocks of overseas companies). These can be broad market, regional or single-country funds. Some specialty equity funds target business sectors, such as health care, commodities and real estate and are known as Sectoral Funds. Ideal Investment Vehicle In many ways, equity funds are ideal investment vehicles for investors that are not as well-versed in financial investing or do not possess a large amount of capital with which to invest. Equity funds are practical investments for most people. The attributes that make equity funds most suitable for small individual investors are the reduction of risk resulting from a fund's portfolio diversification and the relatively small amount of capital required to acquire shares of an equity fund. A large amount of investment capital would be required for an individual investor to achieve a similar degree of risk reduction through diversification of a portfolio of direct stock holdings. Pooling small investors' capital allows an equity fund to diversify effectively without burdening each investor with large capital requirements. The price of the equity fund is based on the fund's net asset value (NAV) less its liabilities. A more diversified fund means that there is less negative effect of an individual stock's adverse price movement on the overall portfolio and on the share price of the equity fund. Equity funds are managed by experienced professional portfolio managers, and their past performance is a matter of public record. Transparency and reporting requirements for equity funds are heavily regulated by the federal government. A Fund for Everyone Equity funds are very popular amongst the retail investors among various categories of mutual fund products.

What is average maturity and how is it useful? Why is it essential to match the investment horizon with that of the scheme? A debt fund is a mutual fund scheme that invests in fixed income instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds, corporate debt securities, and money market instruments etc. that offer capital appreciation. Debt funds are also referred to as Income Funds or Bond Funds. Debt funds are ideal for investors who want regular income, but are risk-averse. Debt funds are less volatile and, hence, are less risky than equity funds. If you have been saving in traditional fixed income products like Term Deposits, and looking for steady returns with low volatility, debt mutual funds could be a better option, as they help you achieve your financial goals in a more tax efficient manner and therefore earn better returns. Debt funds invest in either listed or unlisted debt instruments, such as Corporate and Government Bonds at a certain price and later sell them at a margin. The difference between the cost and sale price accounts for the appreciation or depreciation in the funds net asset value (NAV). Debt funds also receive periodic interest from the underlying debt instruments in which they invest. In terms                   of return, debt funds that earn regular interest from the fixed income instruments during the funds tenure are similar to bank fixed deposits that earn interest. This interest income gets added to a debt fund on a                   daily basis. If the interest payment is received, say, once every year, it is divided by 365 and the debt funds NAV goes up daily by this small amount. Thus, a debt schemes NAV also depends on the interest rates of                   its underlying assets and also on any upgrade or downgrade in the credit rating of its holdings. Market prices of debt securities change with movements in interest rates. Lets assume, your debt fund owns a security that yields 10 % interest. If the interest rate in the economy falls, new instruments issued in the                   market would offer this lower rate.

Given the 'High' risk appetite specified in T001's 'goal_input_json', and the policy defined in the prompt (High → 80/20 equity/debt), I will adjust the allocation to 80% equity and 20% debt. This aligns better with a 'High' risk profile, seeking potentially higher returns with increased volatility. The 'fund_shortlist' from T012 provides a variety of equity fund categories, including Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap, which are suitable for the equity portion of the portfolio. For the debt portion, 'Short Duration Debt' funds are readily available, making them a practical choice. The ELSS option is retained as optional, as it aligns with tax-saving goals but isn't mandatory. The rationale behind this allocation is to maximize potential returns given the high-risk tolerance while ensuring diversification across equity categories and including a debt component for stability.  I also generated the config object for downstream math, mapping the 'High' risk appetite to a 12% annual return.",
