Do not build any plans until you have read SIPGoalPlannerAgent’s outputs.  ________________________________________Wiring Requirement  PlannerAgent MUST first read the outputs from SIPGoalPlannerAgent (especially goal_input_json and computed parameters) before creating the final multi-agent plan graph for retrieval, distillation, Q&A, charts, and report.  ________________________________________User Scenario  Plan a SIP goal with asset allocation and fund category guidance:  goal_type = Retirement  current_age = 50  retirement_age = 60  currency = INR  target_amount_min = 30000000  risk_appetite = High  override_time_horizon_years = 10  ________________________________________Compute (Deterministic)  time_horizon_years =  - For Retirement: max(override_time_horizon_years, retirement_age - current_age)  = max(10, 60 - 50) = 10total_months = time_horizon_years * 12  = 10 * 12 = 120Risk → Return mapping (annual):  very_low: 5%  low: 7%  low_moderate: 8%  moderate: 10%  high_moderate: 11%  high: 12%  very_high: 14%  monthly_return_r = annual_return / 12  For this scenario (High): annual_return = 12% → monthly_return_r = 0.12 / 12 = 0.01  Inflation default: 5.5% annually unless overridden.  ________________________________________Do (Step-by-Step)  Normalize inputs → emit goal_input_json.  Refer “SIP Calculation” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.  Refer “Inflation Adjustment” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.  Refer “Recommendation Engine (Fund Category Types)” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.

What is an Investment Calculator? An investment calculator is an effective tool that allows you to get an idea of the returns on investment from a specific instrument or plan. This is one reason why they are also called Return on Investment (RoI) calculators. Investment calculators are designed to provide potential investors with an estimate of the returns they can expect. For example, an investment calculator helps you estimate the benefits you will receive under the plan you choose, the amount to be invested, payment tenure, and frequency. However, investment returns are not guaranteed by such an online tool. How to use an Investment Calculator? Before you dive deep into how to use an investment calculator, you must know that different calculators are designed to work differently. You can find investment calculators online on the official websites of insurance companies and many others. The working mechanism of an investment calculator may also differ based on the products being sold through it. It is simple and easy to calculate investment returns with the help of an online investment calculator. You can use the investment calculator by following these simple steps: Step 1: Fill in your personal details like full nam\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.axismaxlife.com/investment-plans/investment-calculator/assets/savingplan/know-more-1.png', 'alt_text': 'know-more-1', 'width': '603', 'height': '269', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.axismaxlife.com/investment-plans/investment-calculator/assets/savingplan/know-more-2.png', 'alt_text': 'know-more-2', 'width': '603', 'height': '269', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.axismaxlife.com/investment-plans/investment-calculator/assets/savingplan/know-more-3.png', 'alt_text': 'know-more-3', 'width': '603', 'height': '269', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/investment-plans/investment-calculator/assets/savingplan/bhaskar_sinha.jpg', 'alt_text': 'avatar-image', 'class': 'inline object-cover w-16 mr-2 rounded-full', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/selector/category/7', 'content': 'Just a moment...

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the user's 'High' risk appetite for their retirement goal with a 10-year time horizon, the initial allocation plan suggested a 70/30 split between equity and debt. While this aligns with a general 'High' risk profile, a more aggressive stance, as per the policy guidance, warrants an adjustment to an 80/20 split. This entails allocating 80% of the investment portfolio to equity and 20% to debt instruments. The rationale behind this adjustment is to maximize potential returns over the investment horizon, given the user's risk tolerance. For the equity portion, diversification across Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap funds is recommended to capture growth opportunities across different market segments. For the debt portion, a focus on Short Duration Funds is advised to mitigate interest rate risk. Corporate Bond Funds can be considered for a slightly higher yield, but with careful consideration of credit risk. The config object provides the necessary parameters for downstream math calculations, including the annual return percentage (12% for 'High' risk appetite), monthly return rate, and the default inflation rate (5.5%). The allocation plan is designed to balance risk and return, aligning with the user's aggressive risk profile. However, it is crucial to regularly review and rebalance the portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with the user's goals and risk tolerance. The formula notes are included for clarity in SIP calculations and inflation adjustments. Key factors considered include the user's risk appetite, time horizon, and the need to balance potential returns with risk mitigation. The recommended fund categories are based on a 'High' risk profile, emphasizing growth opportunities in equity while maintaining a conservative allocation to debt for stability.",

An 80/20 equity/debt split is inherently riskier than a 70/30 split, making the portfolio more susceptible to market volatility. Market conditions and economic uncertainties can significantly impact the value of equity investments. Additionally, changes in interest rates can affect the performance of debt instruments. Credit risk should be carefully considered when investing in Corporate Bond Funds, as defaults or downgrades in credit ratings can negatively impact returns. The portfolio should be regularly reviewed and rebalanced to ensure it remains aligned with the investor's goals and risk tolerance. Unforeseen events, such as geopolitical instability, regulatory changes, or unexpected economic downturns, can also introduce uncertainties and potentially impact investment outcomes. Diversification across asset classes and fund categories can help mitigate some of these risks, but it does not guarantee profits or protect against losses. It is essential to conduct thorough research and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions. The investor should be aware of the potential for losses and be prepared to adjust their investment strategy as needed to adapt to changing market conditions and personal circumstances. Currency fluctuations can also impact the value of international investments. Furthermore, inflation rates can vary over time, affecting the real return on investments. Regular monitoring of inflation trends is crucial for ensuring that the portfolio remains on track to meet its long-term goals.</p></section><section id='hidden-signals'><h2>Hidden Signals and Meta Observations</h2><p>The user's high-risk appetite suggests a willingness to tolerate market volatility in pursuit of higher returns. The 10-year time horizon provides a reasonable timeframe for potentially capturing significant growth in equity markets. However, it is crucial to regularly assess the portfolio's performance and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with the investor's risk tolerance and goals. The recommended allocation plan is designed to balance risk and return, aligning with the user's aggressive risk profile. However, it is essential to regularly review and rebalance the portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with the user's goals and risk tolerance.</p></section><section id='source-citations'><h2>Source Citations</h2><p>Data derived from agent outputs T001, T013, T014, and T015.</p></section><section id='final-highlights'><h2>Final Highlights and Recommendations</h2><p>The recommended SIP strategy, featuring an 80/20 equity/debt allocation, is well-suited for the user's high-risk appetite and long-term retirement goal.

What is an Investment Calculator? An investment calculator is an effective tool that allows you to get an idea of the returns on investment from a specific instrument or plan. This is one reason why they are also called Return on Investment (RoI) calculators. Investment calculators are designed to provide potential investors with an estimate of the returns they can expect. For example, an investment calculator helps you estimate the benefits you will receive under the plan you choose, the amount to be invested, payment tenure, and frequency. However, investment returns are not guaranteed by such an online tool. How to use an Investment Calculator? Before you dive deep into how to use an investment calculator, you must know that different calculators are designed to work differently. You can find investment calculators online on the official websites of insurance companies and many others. The working mechanism of an investment calculator may also differ based on the products being sold through it. It is simple and easy to calculate investment returns with the help of an online investment calculator. You can use the investment calculator by following these simple steps: Step 1: Fill in your personal details like full nam\", 'images': [{'url': 'https://www.axismaxlife.com/investment-plans/investment-calculator/assets/savingplan/know-more-1.png', 'alt_text': 'know-more-1', 'width': '603', 'height': '269', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.axismaxlife.com/investment-plans/investment-calculator/assets/savingplan/know-more-2.png', 'alt_text': 'know-more-2', 'width': '603', 'height': '269', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://www.axismaxlife.com/investment-plans/investment-calculator/assets/savingplan/know-more-3.png', 'alt_text': 'know-more-3', 'width': '603', 'height': '269', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://duckduckgo.com/investment-plans/investment-calculator/assets/savingplan/bhaskar_sinha.jpg', 'alt_text': 'avatar-image', 'class': 'inline object-cover w-16 mr-2 rounded-full', 'loading': 'lazy', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/selector/category/7', 'content': 'Just a moment...

While this aligns with a general 'High' risk profile, a more aggressive stance, as per the policy guidance, warrants an adjustment to an 80/20 split. This entails allocating 80% of the investment portfolio to equity and 20% to debt instruments. The rationale behind this adjustment is to maximize potential returns over the investment horizon, given the user's risk tolerance. For the equity portion, diversification across Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap funds is recommended to capture growth opportunities across different market segments. For the debt portion, a focus on Short Duration Funds is advised to mitigate interest rate risk. Corporate Bond Funds can be considered for a slightly higher yield, but with careful consideration of credit risk. The config object provides the necessary parameters for downstream math calculations, including the annual return percentage (12% for 'High' risk appetite), monthly return rate, and the default inflation rate (5.5%). The allocation plan is designed to balance risk and return, aligning with the user's aggressive risk profile. However, it is crucial to regularly review and rebalance the portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with the user's goals and risk tolerance. The formula notes are included for clarity in SIP calculations and inflation adjustments. Key factors considered include the user's risk appetite, time horizon, and the need to balance potential returns with risk mitigation. The recommended fund categories are based on a 'High' risk profile, emphasizing growth opportunities in equity while maintaining a conservative allocation to debt for stability.",

An 80/20 equity/debt split is inherently riskier than a 70/30 split, making the portfolio more susceptible to market volatility. Market conditions and economic uncertainties can significantly impact the value of equity investments. Additionally, changes in interest rates can affect the performance of debt instruments. Credit risk should be carefully considered when investing in Corporate Bond Funds, as defaults or downgrades in credit ratings can negatively impact returns. The portfolio should be regularly reviewed and rebalanced to ensure it remains aligned with the investor's goals and risk tolerance. Unforeseen events, such as geopolitical instability, regulatory changes, or unexpected economic downturns, can also introduce uncertainties and potentially impact investment outcomes. Diversification across asset classes and fund categories can help mitigate some of these risks, but it does not guarantee profits or protect against losses. It is essential to conduct thorough research and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions. The investor should be aware of the potential for losses and be prepared to adjust their investment strategy as needed to adapt to changing market conditions and personal circumstances. Currency fluctuations can also impact the value of international investments. Furthermore, inflation rates can vary over time, affecting the real return on investments. Regular monitoring of inflation trends is crucial for ensuring that the portfolio remains on track to meet its long-term goals.</p></section><section id='hidden-signals'><h2>Hidden Signals and Meta Observations</h2><p>The user's high-risk appetite suggests a willingness to tolerate market volatility in pursuit of higher returns. The 10-year time horizon provides a reasonable timeframe for potentially capturing significant growth in equity markets. However, it is crucial to regularly assess the portfolio's performance and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with the investor's risk tolerance and goals. The recommended allocation plan is designed to balance risk and return, aligning with the user's aggressive risk profile. However, it is essential to regularly review and rebalance the portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with the user's goals and risk tolerance.</p></section><section id='source-citations'><h2>Source Citations</h2><p>Data derived from agent outputs T001, T013, T014, and T015.</p></section><section id='final-highlights'><h2>Final Highlights and Recommendations</h2><p>The recommended SIP strategy, featuring an 80/20 equity/debt allocation, is well-suited for the user's high-risk appetite and long-term retirement goal.
