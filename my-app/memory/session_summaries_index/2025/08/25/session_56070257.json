Do not build any plans until you have read SIPGoalPlannerAgent’s outputs.  ________________________________________Wiring Requirement  PlannerAgent MUST first read the outputs from SIPGoalPlannerAgent (especially goal_input_json and computed parameters) before creating the final multi-agent plan graph for retrieval, distillation, Q&A, charts, and report.  ________________________________________User Scenario  Plan a SIP goal with asset allocation and fund category guidance:  goal_type = Retirement  current_age = 50  retirement_age = 60  currency = INR  target_amount_min = 30000000  risk_appetite = High  override_time_horizon_years = 10  ________________________________________Compute (Deterministic)  time_horizon_years =  - For Retirement: max(override_time_horizon_years, retirement_age - current_age)  = max(10, 60 - 50) = 10total_months = time_horizon_years * 12  = 10 * 12 = 120Risk → Return mapping (annual):  very_low: 5%  low: 7%  low_moderate: 8%  moderate: 10%  high_moderate: 11%  high: 12%  very_high: 14%  monthly_return_r = annual_return / 12  For this scenario (High): annual_return = 12% → monthly_return_r = 0.12 / 12 = 0.01  Inflation default: 5.5% annually unless overridden.  ________________________________________Do (Step-by-Step)  Normalize inputs → emit goal_input_json.  Refer “SIP Calculation” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.  Refer “Inflation Adjustment” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.  Refer “Recommendation Engine (Fund Category Types)” from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the provided information, the user's risk appetite is 'High,' which corresponds to an 80% equity and 20% debt allocation according to the defined policy. The allocation was previously set at 70% equity and 30% debt, which does not align with the policy. Therefore, the allocation plan has been adjusted to reflect the correct percentages. The rationale for this adjustment is to ensure the portfolio aligns with the user's stated risk tolerance and the established investment policy. This aligns with the `T001` context specifying a 'High' risk appetite, which maps to a higher equity allocation. The updated allocation is more aggressive, which is suitable for a long-term retirement goal with a high-risk tolerance. Furthermore, a config object has been created for downstream mathematical operations, including the annual return percentage, monthly return rate, and the default inflation rate. The annual return is set at 14% for a 'High' risk appetite, with a monthly return rate calculated as 14%/12/100. The default inflation rate remains at 5.5%. The selection of equity funds for this allocation should consider diversification across market capitalizations (Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap) and sectors. The debt component should include funds with varying maturities and credit ratings, such as Short Term Debt and Corporate Bond funds. The fund shortlist from `T012` includes several PGIM India funds that fit these categories, though further analysis is needed to determine specific fund suitability. The rationale behind these category recommendations is to provide a diversified portfolio that can withstand market fluctuations and generate optimal returns over the long term. However, it is important to note that this allocation is based on the provided information and general investment principles. It is recommended to seek advice from a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. While I'm recommending a shift to 80/20 per the input policy, real-world portfolios sometimes make smaller adjustments or blend policy tiers (e.g., toward 75/25). The downstream agent should apply discretion where appropriate, especially if other signals suggest constraints. Also, note that 'Risk Factor: Very High' dominates in the fund shortlist from T012 -- this should be a warning sign when real-world fund choices are narrowed. Over-concentration in a single fund family (PGIM) is also a potential weakness. These warnings do NOT require changing the 80/20 allocation itself, but they do highlight concerns when building a real portfolio given the current data.",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the provided information, the user's risk appetite is 'High,' which corresponds to an 80% equity and 20% debt allocation according to the defined policy. The allocation was previously set at 70% equity and 30% debt, which does not align with the policy. Therefore, the allocation plan has been adjusted to reflect the correct percentages. The rationale for this adjustment is to ensure the portfolio aligns with the user's stated risk tolerance and the established investment policy. This aligns with the `T001` context specifying a 'High' risk appetite, which maps to a higher equity allocation. The updated allocation is more aggressive, which is suitable for a long-term retirement goal with a high-risk tolerance. Furthermore, a config object has been created for downstream mathematical operations, including the annual return percentage, monthly return rate, and the default inflation rate. The annual return is set at 14% for a 'High' risk appetite, with a monthly return rate calculated as 14%/12/100. The default inflation rate remains at 5.5%. The selection of equity funds for this allocation should consider diversification across market capitalizations (Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap) and sectors. The debt component should include funds with varying maturities and credit ratings, such as Short Term Debt and Corporate Bond funds. The fund shortlist from `T012` includes several PGIM India funds that fit these categories, though further analysis is needed to determine specific fund suitability. The rationale behind these category recommendations is to provide a diversified portfolio that can withstand market fluctuations and generate optimal returns over the long term. However, it is important to note that this allocation is based on the provided information and general investment principles. It is recommended to seek advice from a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. While I'm recommending a shift to 80/20 per the input policy, real-world portfolios sometimes make smaller adjustments or blend policy tiers (e.g., toward 75/25). The downstream agent should apply discretion where appropriate, especially if other signals suggest constraints. Also, note that 'Risk Factor: Very High' dominates in the fund shortlist from T012 -- this should be a warning sign when real-world fund choices are narrowed. Over-concentration in a single fund family (PGIM) is also a potential weakness. These warnings do NOT require changing the 80/20 allocation itself, but they do highlight concerns when building a real portfolio given the current data.",
