A letter of credit is a crucial financial instrument in international trade, providing a guarantee from a bank that a buyers payment to a seller will occur on time and for the specified amount. When buyers face challenges in meeting their financial commitments, the bank steps in to cover unpaid amounts, ensuring seamless trade transactions. This arrangement is vital in overcoming challenges inherent in international dealings, such as differing national laws and the geographical distance between trading parties. As a result, letters of credit are indispensable in protecting both buyers and sellers from potential risks during trade.

A Letter of Credit (LC) is essentially a document from a bank guaranteeing that a buyers payment to a seller will be received on time, for the correct amount and in the correct currency. In the event that the buyer is unable to make a payment on the purchase, the bank will be required to cover the full or remaining amount of the purchase. An LC is a payment term typically used for long-distance and international commercial transactions and is a key instrument used by importers, exporters, and banks in Trade Finance. It is a way of reducing the payment risks associated with moving goods globally. Using documentary letters of credit allows the seller to significantly reduce the risk of non-payment for delivered goods. Key Learning Points A Letter of Credit is a document from a bank offering to guarantee that a buyers payment will be made on time, for the correct amount and in the correct currency If the buyer does not make the payment then the bank is liable for the outstanding amount still owing Essentially a bank is substituted as a source of payment and in return the bank collects a transaction fee and may also require collateral Letters of credit are the foundation of International Trade Finance by providing a secure mechanism for payments on import/export without tying up cash resources There are many different types of letters of credit including basic types (e.g. confirmed versus unco', 'images': [{'url': 'https://media.fe.training/2025/08/6yhhhbkd-desktop-popup-no-sale-aug-2025.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Black Friday Sale Image', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.dripcapital.com/en-in/resources/finance-guides/letter-of-credit-lc', 'content': 'Letter of Credit (LC) - Meaning, Process & Role In International Trade For Exporter For Investor For Partner Company Resources Get Export Finance For Exporter For Investor For Partner Company Resources Get Export Finance Share Trade Finance 21 February 2023 Letter of Credit [LC] Explained with Process & Example There are several uncertainties that arise when buyers and sellers across the globe engage in maritime trade operations. Some of these uncertainties revolve around delayed payments, slow deliveries, and financing-related issues, among others. The sheer distances involved in international trade, different laws and regulations, and changing political landscape are just some of the reasons for sellers needing a guarantee of payment when they deliver goods through the maritime route to their sellers. Letters of credit were introduced to address this by adding a third party like a financial institution into the transaction to mitigate credit risks for exporters. What is a Letter of Credit? A letter of credit or LC is a written document issued by the importers bank (opening bank) on importers behalf. Through its issuance, the exporter is assured that the issuing bank will make a payment to the exporter for the international trade conducted between both the parties. The importer is the applicant of the LC, while the exporter is the beneficiary. In an LC, the issuing bank promises to pay the mentioned amount as per the agreed timeline and against specified documents. A guiding principle of an LC is that the issuing bank will make the payment based solely on the documents presented, and they are not required to physically ensure the shipping of the goods. If the documents presented are in accord with the terms and conditions of the LC, the bank has no reason to deny the payment. Why is Letter of Credit important? A letter of credit is beneficial for both the parties as it assures the seller that he will receive his funds upon fulfillment of terms of the trade agreement and the buyer can portray his creditworthiness and negotiate longer payment terms, by having a bank back the trade transaction. Features / Characteristics of letter of credit A letter of credit is identified by certain principles. These principles remain the same for all kinds of letters of credit. The main characteristics of letters of credit are as follows: Negotiability A letter of credit is a transactional deal, under which the terms can be modified/changed at the parties assent. In order to be negotiable, a letter of credit should include an unconditional promise of payment upon demand or at a particular point in time. Revocability A letter of credit can be revocable or irrevocable. Since a revocable letter of credit cannot be confirmed, the duty to pay can be revoked at any point of time. In an irrevocable letter of credit, all the parties hold power, it cannot be changed/modified without the agreed consent of all the people. Transfer and Assignment A letter of credit can be transferred, also the beneficiary has the right to transfer/assign the LC. The LC will remain effective no matter how many times the beneficiary assigns/transfers the LC. Sight & Time Drafts The beneficiary will only receive the payment upon maturity of letter of credit from the issuing bank when he presents all the drafts & the necessary documents.

LC is an arrangement whereby the issuing bank can act on the request and instruction of the applicant (importer) or on their own behalf. Under an LC arrangement, the issuing bank can make a payment to (or to the order of) the beneficiary (that is, the exporter). Alternatively, the issuing bank can accept the bills of exchange or draft that are drawn by the exporter. The issuing bank can also authorize advising or nominated banks to pa', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://accountinginsights.org/understanding-letter-of-credit-facilities-types-processes-and-uses/', 'content': 'Understanding Letter of Credit Facilities: Types, Processes, and Uses - Accounting Insights Home Accounting Concepts and Practices Auditing and Corporate Governance Business and Accounting Technology Financial Planning and Analysis Investment and Financial Markets Taxation and Regulatory Compliance Contact Us Account Register Sign In Investment and Financial Markets Understanding Letter of Credit Facilities: Types, Processes, and Uses Explore the various types of letter of credit facilities, their issuance process, key parties involved, and their crucial role in international trade. AccountingInsights Team Published Sep 18, 2024 Businesses engaged in international trade often face the challenge of ensuring payment security and trust between parties. One financial instrument that addresses these concerns is the letter of credit (LC). This tool not only mitigates risks but also facilitates smoother transactions across borders, making it a cornerstone in global commerce. Understanding how letters of credit work, their various types, and the processes involved can provide valuable insights for businesses looking to optimize their operations and secure their interests. Types of Letter of Credit Facilities Letters of credit come in several forms, each tailored to meet specific needs and circumstances in trade transactions. Understanding the distinctions between these types can help businesses choose the most appropriate instrument for their particular situation. Commercial Letters of Credit Commercial letters of credit, also known as documentary credits, are the most common type used in international trade. They serve as a payment mechanism where the issuing bank commits to pay the beneficiary (usually the exporter) upon presentation of specified documents that prove shipment of goods or services. These documents typically include a bill of lading, commercial invoice, and packing list. The commercial LC ensures that the seller receives payment as long as they comply with the terms set forth in the agreement, thereby reducing the risk of non-payment. This type of LC is particularly useful in transactions where the buyer and seller have limited trust or are dealing with large sums of money. Standby Letters of Credit Standby letters of credit function as a safety net rather than a primary payment method. They are often used as a guarantee of payment in case the buyer fails to fulfill their contractual obligations. In essence, a standby LC acts as a form of insurance for the beneficiary. If the buyer defaults, the beneficiary can present the required documents to the issuing bank to claim payment. This type of LC is commonly used in construction projects, service contracts, and other scenarios where performance guarantees are necessary. The standby LC provides assurance to the seller or service provider that they will be compensated even if the buyer does not meet their commitments. Revolving Letters of Credit Revolving letters of credit are designed for ongoing transactions between the same buyer and seller. Unlike a standard LC, which is used for a single transaction, a revolving LC can be reused multiple times up to a specified limit and within a set period. This arrangement is particularly beneficial for businesses that engage in regular shipments of goods, as it eliminates the need to issue a new LC for each transaction. Revolving LCs can be either cumulative, where unused amounts can be carried forward, or non-cumulative, where unused amounts expire at the end of each period. This type of LC streamlines the process and reduces administrative costs for both parties involved in frequent trade activities. Key Parties Involved in a Letter of Credit A letter of credit involves several key parties, each playing a distinct role in ensuring the transactions success. The primary participants include the applicant, the beneficiary, the issuing bank, and the advising bank.

These risks include:\n\n*   **Payment Risk:** The seller risks non-payment by the buyer due to insolvency, unwillingness to pay, or other financial difficulties.\n*   **Delivery Risk:** The buyer risks non-delivery of the goods by the seller, or delivery of goods that do not conform to the agreed-upon specifications.\n*   **Political Risk:** Changes in government regulations, trade restrictions, or political instability in either the buyer's or seller's country can disrupt the transaction.\n\nBy involving a reputable bank, the letter of credit shifts these risks from the individual parties to the financial institution, providing a level of security and assurance that encourages international trade.\n\n**Process:**\nThe letter of credit process typically involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Sale Contract:** The buyer and seller agree on the terms of the sale, including the goods, price, payment terms, and required documents.\n2.  **Application:** The buyer applies to their bank (the issuing bank) for a letter of credit, specifying the terms and conditions.\n3.  **Issuance:** The issuing bank reviews the application and, if approved, issues the letter of credit.\n4.  **Advising:** The issuing bank sends the letter of credit to a bank in the seller’s country (the advising bank), which verifies its authenticity and advises the seller.\n5.  **Shipment:** The seller ships the goods and obtains the required documents, such as the bill of lading, commercial invoice, and packing list.\n6.  **Presentation:** The seller presents the documents to the advising bank, which examines them to ensure compliance with the letter of credit terms.\n7.  **Payment:** If the documents are in order, the advising bank pays the seller (or negotiates the credit) and sends the documents to the issuing bank.\n8.  **Reimbursement:** The issuing bank reimburses the advising bank and releases the documents to the buyer, who can then take possession of the goods.\n\n**Parties Involved:**\nThe key parties involved in a letter of credit transaction are:\n\n*   **Applicant (Importer/Buyer):** The party who applies for the letter of credit and is responsible for paying the issuing bank.\n*   **Beneficiary (Exporter/Seller):** The party who receives the letter of credit and is entitled to payment upon presentation of conforming documents.\n*   **Issuing Bank:** The bank that issues the letter of credit on behalf of the applicant and guarantees payment to the beneficiary.\n*   **Advising Bank:** The bank that advises the beneficiary of the letter of credit's issuance and verifies its authenticity. It may also act as a paying or negotiating bank.\n*   **Confirming Bank (Optional):** A bank that adds its own guarantee to the letter of credit, providing an additional layer of security for the beneficiary, especially if the issuing bank is in a politically unstable or financially risky country.\n*   **Negotiating Bank (Optional):** The bank that is authorized to negotiate the documents and make the payment to the beneficiary. This could be the advising bank or any other bank nominated in the LC.\n\n**Key Documents:**\nThe following documents are commonly required in a letter of credit transaction:\n\n*   **Commercial Invoice:** A document that lists the goods, price, quantity, and other details of the transaction.\n*   **Bill of Lading:** A document issued by the shipping company acknowledging receipt of the goods and serving as a title document.\n*   **Packing List:** A document that details the contents of each package or container.\n*   **Insurance Certificate:** A document that provides evidence of insurance coverage for the goods during transit.\n*   **Certificate of Origin:** A document that certifies the country of origin of the goods.\n*   **Inspection Certificate:** A document certifying that goods meets quality standards.\n\n**Types of Letters of Credit:**\nSeveral types of letters of credit exist to cater to various trade scenarios. Some common types include:\n\n*   **Irrevocable LC:** An LC that cannot be amended or cancelled without the consent of all parties involved (applicant, issuing bank, and beneficiary). This type offers the highest level of security for the beneficiary.\n*   **Revocable LC:** An LC that can be amended or cancelled by the issuing bank at any time without prior notice to the beneficiary. This type offers little security for the beneficiary and is rarely used.\n*   **Confirmed LC:** An irrevocable LC that is confirmed by another bank (the confirming bank), providing an additional guarantee of payment to the beneficiary.\n*   **Unconfirmed LC:** An irrevocable LC that is not confirmed by another bank. The beneficiary relies solely on the issuing bank's guarantee.\n*   **Standby LC:** An LC that serves as a guarantee of performance or payment. It is used when the applicant fails to fulfill their contractual obligations.\n*   **Revolving LC:** An LC that can be used repeatedly for multiple shipments up to a specified amount and within a specified period.\n*   **Transferable LC:** An LC that allows the original beneficiary to transfer their rights to another party (the second beneficiary). This is useful when the original beneficiary is a middleman or trading company.\n*   **Back-to-Back LC:** A new LC issued based on an existing LC. The original beneficiary uses the original LC as security to obtain a new LC in favor of their supplier.\n\nLetters of credit are invaluable tools in facilitating and securing international trade transactions, offering protection and assurance to both buyers and sellers in a complex and often uncertain global marketplace.",

A letter of credit is a crucial financial instrument in international trade, providing a guarantee from a bank that a buyers payment to a seller will occur on time and for the specified amount. When buyers face challenges in meeting their financial commitments, the bank steps in to cover unpaid amounts, ensuring seamless trade transactions. This arrangement is vital in overcoming challenges inherent in international dealings, such as differing national laws and the geographical distance between trading parties. As a result, letters of credit are indispensable in protecting both buyers and sellers from potential risks during trade.

A Letter of Credit (LC) is essentially a document from a bank guaranteeing that a buyers payment to a seller will be received on time, for the correct amount and in the correct currency. In the event that the buyer is unable to make a payment on the purchase, the bank will be required to cover the full or remaining amount of the purchase. An LC is a payment term typically used for long-distance and international commercial transactions and is a key instrument used by importers, exporters, and banks in Trade Finance. It is a way of reducing the payment risks associated with moving goods globally. Using documentary letters of credit allows the seller to significantly reduce the risk of non-payment for delivered goods. Key Learning Points A Letter of Credit is a document from a bank offering to guarantee that a buyers payment will be made on time, for the correct amount and in the correct currency If the buyer does not make the payment then the bank is liable for the outstanding amount still owing Essentially a bank is substituted as a source of payment and in return the bank collects a transaction fee and may also require collateral Letters of credit are the foundation of International Trade Finance by providing a secure mechanism for payments on import/export without tying up cash resources There are many different types of letters of credit including basic types (e.g. confirmed versus unco', 'images': [{'url': 'https://media.fe.training/2025/08/6yhhhbkd-desktop-popup-no-sale-aug-2025.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Black Friday Sale Image', 'confidence': 0.7}], 'rank': 2}, {'url': 'https://www.dripcapital.com/en-in/resources/finance-guides/letter-of-credit-lc', 'content': 'Letter of Credit (LC) - Meaning, Process & Role In International Trade For Exporter For Investor For Partner Company Resources Get Export Finance For Exporter For Investor For Partner Company Resources Get Export Finance Share Trade Finance 21 February 2023 Letter of Credit [LC] Explained with Process & Example There are several uncertainties that arise when buyers and sellers across the globe engage in maritime trade operations. Some of these uncertainties revolve around delayed payments, slow deliveries, and financing-related issues, among others. The sheer distances involved in international trade, different laws and regulations, and changing political landscape are just some of the reasons for sellers needing a guarantee of payment when they deliver goods through the maritime route to their sellers. Letters of credit were introduced to address this by adding a third party like a financial institution into the transaction to mitigate credit risks for exporters. What is a Letter of Credit? A letter of credit or LC is a written document issued by the importers bank (opening bank) on importers behalf. Through its issuance, the exporter is assured that the issuing bank will make a payment to the exporter for the international trade conducted between both the parties. The importer is the applicant of the LC, while the exporter is the beneficiary. In an LC, the issuing bank promises to pay the mentioned amount as per the agreed timeline and against specified documents. A guiding principle of an LC is that the issuing bank will make the payment based solely on the documents presented, and they are not required to physically ensure the shipping of the goods. If the documents presented are in accord with the terms and conditions of the LC, the bank has no reason to deny the payment. Why is Letter of Credit important? A letter of credit is beneficial for both the parties as it assures the seller that he will receive his funds upon fulfillment of terms of the trade agreement and the buyer can portray his creditworthiness and negotiate longer payment terms, by having a bank back the trade transaction. Features / Characteristics of letter of credit A letter of credit is identified by certain principles. These principles remain the same for all kinds of letters of credit. The main characteristics of letters of credit are as follows: Negotiability A letter of credit is a transactional deal, under which the terms can be modified/changed at the parties assent. In order to be negotiable, a letter of credit should include an unconditional promise of payment upon demand or at a particular point in time. Revocability A letter of credit can be revocable or irrevocable. Since a revocable letter of credit cannot be confirmed, the duty to pay can be revoked at any point of time. In an irrevocable letter of credit, all the parties hold power, it cannot be changed/modified without the agreed consent of all the people. Transfer and Assignment A letter of credit can be transferred, also the beneficiary has the right to transfer/assign the LC. The LC will remain effective no matter how many times the beneficiary assigns/transfers the LC. Sight & Time Drafts The beneficiary will only receive the payment upon maturity of letter of credit from the issuing bank when he presents all the drafts & the necessary documents.

LC is an arrangement whereby the issuing bank can act on the request and instruction of the applicant (importer) or on their own behalf. Under an LC arrangement, the issuing bank can make a payment to (or to the order of) the beneficiary (that is, the exporter). Alternatively, the issuing bank can accept the bills of exchange or draft that are drawn by the exporter. The issuing bank can also authorize advising or nominated banks to pa', 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://accountinginsights.org/understanding-letter-of-credit-facilities-types-processes-and-uses/', 'content': 'Understanding Letter of Credit Facilities: Types, Processes, and Uses - Accounting Insights Home Accounting Concepts and Practices Auditing and Corporate Governance Business and Accounting Technology Financial Planning and Analysis Investment and Financial Markets Taxation and Regulatory Compliance Contact Us Account Register Sign In Investment and Financial Markets Understanding Letter of Credit Facilities: Types, Processes, and Uses Explore the various types of letter of credit facilities, their issuance process, key parties involved, and their crucial role in international trade. AccountingInsights Team Published Sep 18, 2024 Businesses engaged in international trade often face the challenge of ensuring payment security and trust between parties. One financial instrument that addresses these concerns is the letter of credit (LC). This tool not only mitigates risks but also facilitates smoother transactions across borders, making it a cornerstone in global commerce. Understanding how letters of credit work, their various types, and the processes involved can provide valuable insights for businesses looking to optimize their operations and secure their interests. Types of Letter of Credit Facilities Letters of credit come in several forms, each tailored to meet specific needs and circumstances in trade transactions. Understanding the distinctions between these types can help businesses choose the most appropriate instrument for their particular situation. Commercial Letters of Credit Commercial letters of credit, also known as documentary credits, are the most common type used in international trade. They serve as a payment mechanism where the issuing bank commits to pay the beneficiary (usually the exporter) upon presentation of specified documents that prove shipment of goods or services. These documents typically include a bill of lading, commercial invoice, and packing list. The commercial LC ensures that the seller receives payment as long as they comply with the terms set forth in the agreement, thereby reducing the risk of non-payment. This type of LC is particularly useful in transactions where the buyer and seller have limited trust or are dealing with large sums of money. Standby Letters of Credit Standby letters of credit function as a safety net rather than a primary payment method. They are often used as a guarantee of payment in case the buyer fails to fulfill their contractual obligations. In essence, a standby LC acts as a form of insurance for the beneficiary. If the buyer defaults, the beneficiary can present the required documents to the issuing bank to claim payment. This type of LC is commonly used in construction projects, service contracts, and other scenarios where performance guarantees are necessary. The standby LC provides assurance to the seller or service provider that they will be compensated even if the buyer does not meet their commitments. Revolving Letters of Credit Revolving letters of credit are designed for ongoing transactions between the same buyer and seller. Unlike a standard LC, which is used for a single transaction, a revolving LC can be reused multiple times up to a specified limit and within a set period. This arrangement is particularly beneficial for businesses that engage in regular shipments of goods, as it eliminates the need to issue a new LC for each transaction. Revolving LCs can be either cumulative, where unused amounts can be carried forward, or non-cumulative, where unused amounts expire at the end of each period. This type of LC streamlines the process and reduces administrative costs for both parties involved in frequent trade activities. Key Parties Involved in a Letter of Credit A letter of credit involves several key parties, each playing a distinct role in ensuring the transactions success. The primary participants include the applicant, the beneficiary, the issuing bank, and the advising bank.

It's a guarantee from a bank that a buyer's payment to a seller will be received on time and for the correct amount.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: A letter of credit (LC) is a crucial financial instrument, predominantly employed in international trade, designed to mitigate risks and facilitate secure transactions between buyers and sellers who may be separated by considerable geographical distances and differing legal jurisdictions. Essentially, it acts as a guarantee from a bank that a buyer’s payment to a seller will be honored on time and for the agreed-upon amount.\n\n**Definition:**\nAn LC is a written undertaking issued by a bank (the issuing bank) on behalf of its customer, the buyer or importer (the applicant), assuring the seller or exporter (the beneficiary) that payment will be made up to a stated amount, within a prescribed time, and against the presentation of stipulated documents that comply strictly with the terms and conditions of the credit.\n\n**Purpose:**\nThe primary purpose of a letter of credit is to reduce the risk associated with international trade. These risks include:\n\n*   **Payment Risk:** The seller risks non-payment by the buyer due to insolvency, unwillingness to pay, or other financial difficulties.\n*   **Delivery Risk:** The buyer risks non-delivery of the goods by the seller, or delivery of goods that do not conform to the agreed-upon specifications.\n*   **Political Risk:** Changes in government regulations, trade restrictions, or political instability in either the buyer's or seller's country can disrupt the transaction.\n\nBy involving a reputable bank, the letter of credit shifts these risks from the individual parties to the financial institution, providing a level of security and assurance that encourages international trade.\n\n**Process:**\nThe letter of credit process typically involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Sale Contract:** The buyer and seller agree on the terms of the sale, including the goods, price, payment terms, and required documents.\n2.  **Application:** The buyer applies to their bank (the issuing bank) for a letter of credit, specifying the terms and conditions.\n3.  **Issuance:** The issuing bank reviews the application and, if approved, issues the letter of credit.\n4.  **Advising:** The issuing bank sends the letter of credit to a bank in the seller’s country (the advising bank), which verifies its authenticity and advises the seller.\n5.  **Shipment:** The seller ships the goods and obtains the required documents, such as the bill of lading, commercial invoice, and packing list.\n6.  **Presentation:** The seller presents the documents to the advising bank, which examines them to ensure compliance with the letter of credit terms.\n7.  **Payment:** If the documents are in order, the advising bank pays the seller (or negotiates the credit) and sends the documents to the issuing bank.\n8.  **Reimbursement:** The issuing bank reimburses the advising bank and releases the documents to the buyer, who can then take possession of the goods.\n\n**Parties Involved:**\nThe key parties involved in a letter of credit transaction are:\n\n*   **Applicant (Importer/Buyer):** The party who applies for the letter of credit and is responsible for paying the issuing bank.\n*   **Beneficiary (Exporter/Seller):** The party who receives the letter of credit and is entitled to payment upon presentation of conforming documents.\n*   **Issuing Bank:** The bank that issues the letter of credit on behalf of the applicant and guarantees payment to the beneficiary.\n*   **Advising Bank:** The bank that advises the beneficiary of the letter of credit's issuance and verifies its authenticity. It may also act as a paying or negotiating bank.\n*   **Confirming Bank (Optional):** A bank that adds its own guarantee to the letter of credit, providing an additional layer of security for the beneficiary, especially if the issuing bank is in a politically unstable or financially risky country.\n*   **Negotiating Bank (Optional):** The bank that is authorized to negotiate the documents and make the payment to the beneficiary. This could be the advising bank or any other bank nominated in the LC.\n\n**Key Documents:**\nThe following documents are commonly required in a letter of credit transaction:\n\n*   **Commercial Invoice:** A document that lists the goods, price, quantity, and other details of the transaction.\n*   **Bill of Lading:** A document issued by the shipping company acknowledging receipt of the goods and serving as a title document.\n*   **Packing List:** A document that details the contents of each package or container.\n*   **Insurance Certificate:** A document that provides evidence of insurance coverage for the goods during transit.\n*   **Certificate of Origin:** A document that certifies the country of origin of the goods.\n*   **Inspection Certificate:** A document certifying that goods meets quality standards.\n\n**Types of Letters of Credit:**\nSeveral types of letters of credit exist to cater to various trade scenarios. Some common types include:\n\n*   **Irrevocable LC:** An LC that cannot be amended or cancelled without the consent of all parties involved (applicant, issuing bank, and beneficiary). This type offers the highest level of security for the beneficiary.\n*   **Revocable LC:** An LC that can be amended or cancelled by the issuing bank at any time without prior notice to the beneficiary. This type offers little security for the beneficiary and is rarely used.\n*   **Confirmed LC:** An irrevocable LC that is confirmed by another bank (the confirming bank), providing an additional guarantee of payment to the beneficiary.\n*   **Unconfirmed LC:** An irrevocable LC that is not confirmed by another bank. The beneficiary relies solely on the issuing bank's guarantee.\n*   **Standby LC:** An LC that serves as a guarantee of performance or payment. It is used when the applicant fails to fulfill their contractual obligations.\n*   **Revolving LC:** An LC that can be used repeatedly for multiple shipments up to a specified amount and within a specified period.\n*   **Transferable LC:** An LC that allows the original beneficiary to transfer their rights to another party (the second beneficiary). This is useful when the original beneficiary is a middleman or trading company.\n*   **Back-to-Back LC:** A new LC issued based on an existing LC. The original beneficiary uses the original LC as security to obtain a new LC in favor of their supplier.\n\nLetters of credit are invaluable tools in facilitating and securing international trade transactions, offering protection and assurance to both buyers and sellers in a complex and often uncertain global marketplace.",
