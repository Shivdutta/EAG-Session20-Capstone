June 06, 2025 06:33 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Asia-Pacific Paints & Coating Market, By Country, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities 2020-2030F\" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com\\'s offering. The Asia-Pacific Paints & Coating Market was valued at USD 60.15 Billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 93.40 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 7.45% Market growth is fueled by accelerated urbanization, infrastructure development, and industrial expansion in countries such as China, India, Japan, and across Southeast Asia. Rising construction activities in both residential and commercial segments are significantly increasing the demand for decorative and protective coatings. Furthermore, a growing shift toward eco-friendly, water-based products - driven by environmental awareness, stricter regulations, and the adoption of green building norms - is reshaping product innovation and formulation strategies. Governments in the region are introducing VOC emission regulations, prompting manufacturers to focus on sustainable and high-performance coatings. This regulatory push, combined with smart city initiatives and infrastructure modernization, is driving advancements in product durability, environmental safety, and functional performance, supporting robust growth in the regional paints and coatings industry. Rapid Urbanization and Infrastructure Growth The Asia-Pacific region is undergoing swift urban development, especially in countries like China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, which is significantly boosting demand for paints and coatings across both new construction and refurbishment projects. As of 2024, over 55% of the population resides in urban areas - a figure expected to climb to nearly 65% by 2030. Governments are actively investing in smart city development and infrastructure enhancements, including housing, commercial buildings, bridges, airports, and metro systems. In India, for example, more than 100 smart city projects are progressing, stimulating the need for protective coatings on steel, concrete, and wooden surfaces. Around 20 million new residential units are also being constructed annually, contributing to increased consumption of both interior and exterior coatings. Maintenance activities for public infrastructure, growing at an estimated 10% per year, are also driving recurring demand. Paints and coatings are now essential not only for aesthetic purposes but also for protecting structures against environmental damage. This rising need has prompted manufacturers to scale up production capacities across Southeast Asia, establishing urban and infrastructure growth as a key market driver. Fluctuating Raw Material Prices The volatility in raw material costs remains a major challenge for the Asia-Pacific paints and coatings market. Essential inputs such as titanium dioxide, resins, acrylics, and solvents are subject to frequent price fluctuations driven by crude oil market dynamics, geopolitical instability, and global supply chain constraints. As many countries in the region, including India and Vietnam, rely on imports for these materials, any disruption significantly impacts production costs. Titanium dioxide alone can constitute up to a quarter of the cost in decorative coatings, and its price has seen cons', 'images': [], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.giiresearch.com/report/psm1779961-asia-pacific-paints-coatings-market-size-share.html', 'content': \"Asia-Pacific Paints and Coatings Market Size & Share Analysis - Trends, Drivers, Competitive Landscape, and Forecasts (2025 - 2032) Questions? +1-866-353-3335 0 Reports Custom Research Research Partners FAQ Enterprise Solution Contact Us Fraud Alert English English 0 Reports Custom Research Research Partners FAQ Enterprise Solution Contact Us Fraud Alert Questions? +1-866-353-3335 SEARCH What are you looking for?

Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca.

We are in a phase where the underlying bias of volatility has turned bearish. Given that valuations are high, there is a case to be selective if you are putting in fresh money.

The Asia-Pacific paints and coatings industry is experiencing a significant transformation driven by increasing environmental consciousness and regulatory pressures. Major manufacturers are actively developing eco-friendly paint and coating solutions with lower volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. This shift is particularly evident in countries like South Korea, where the Ministry of Environment has revised the Clean Air Conservation Act's enforcement rules for VOCs, limiting paint VOC content to a maximum of 67%. The industry's commitment to sustainability is further demonstrated by companies like Teknos, which announced its support for research in developing binders and coatings that are 80-100% bio-based in November 2022. The region's robust manufacturing sector continues to drive demand for industrial coatings across various applications. South Korea's prominence in electronics manufacturing, accounting for over 9% of global electronics and computer production in 2021, exemplifies the strong industrial base supporting market growth.

and infrastructure growth in China, India, and Southeast Asia, leading to increased demand for decorative and protective coatings. There is a strong shift towards eco-friendly, water-based products due to environmental awareness and regulations. June 06, 2025 06:33 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Asia-Pacific Paints & Coating Market, By Country, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities 2020-2030F\" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com\\'s offering. The Asia-Pacific Paints & Coating Market was valued at USD 60.15 Billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 93.40 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 7.45% Market growth is fueled by accelerated urbanization, infrastructure development, and industrial expansion in countries such as China, India, Japan, and across Southeast Asia. Rising construction activities in both residential and commercial segments are significantly increasing the demand for decorative and protective coatings. Furthermore, a growing shift toward eco-friendly, water-based products - driven by environmental awareness, stricter regulations, and the adoption of green building norms - is reshaping product innovation and formulation strategies. Governments in the region are introducing VOC emission regulations, prompting manufacturers to focus on sustainable and high-performance coatings. This regulatory push, combined with smart city initiatives and infrastructure modernization, is driving advancements in product durability, environmental safety, and functional performance, supporting robust growth in the regional paints and coatings industry. Rapid Urbanization and Infrastructure Growth The Asia-Pacific region is undergoing swift urban development, especially in countries like China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, which is significantly boosting demand for paints and coatings across both new construction and refurbishment projects. As of 2024, over 55% of the population resides in urban areas - a figure expected to climb to nearly 65% by 2030. Governments are actively investing in smart city development and infrastructure enhancements, including housing, commercial buildings, bridges, airports, and metro systems. In India, for example, more than 100 smart city projects are progressing, stimulating the need for protective coatings on steel, concrete, and wooden surfaces. Around 20 million new residential units are also being constructed annually, contributing to increased consumption of both interior and exterior coatings. Maintenance activities for public infrastructure, growing at an estimated 10% per year, are also driving recurring demand. Paints and coatings are now essential not only for aesthetic purposes but also for protecting structures against environmental damage. This rising need has prompted manufacturers to scale up production capacities across Southeast Asia, establishing urban and infrastructure growth as a key market driver. Fluctuating Raw Material Prices The volatility in raw material costs remains a major challenge for the Asia-Pacific paints and coatings market. Essential inputs such as titanium dioxide, resins, acrylics, and solvents are subject to frequent price fluctuations driven by crude oil market dynamics, geopolitical instability, and global supply chain constraints. As many countries in the region, including India and Vietnam, rely on imports for these materials, any disruption significantly impacts production costs. Titanium dioxide alone can constitute up to a quarter of the cost in decorative coatings, and its price has seen cons', 'images': [], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.giiresearch.com/report/psm1779961-asia-pacific-paints-coatings-market-size-share.html', 'content': \"Asia-Pacific Paints and Coatings Market Size & Share Analysis - Trends, Drivers, Competitive Landscape, and Forecasts (2025 - 2032) Questions? +1-866-353-3335 0 Reports Custom Research Research Partners FAQ Enterprise Solution Contact Us Fraud Alert English English 0 Reports Custom Research Research Partners FAQ Enterprise Solution Contact Us Fraud Alert Questions? +1-866-353-3335 SEARCH What are you looking for?

Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani, and Arvind Vakil founded the company in 1942. A temporary ban on paint imports during WWII and the Quit India Movement created an opportunity for Asian Paints to conquer the Indian market. By 1967, the company was Indias leading paint manufacturer. Asian Paints seeks to transform itself into a complete home decor and lifestyle brand. In May 2023, Asian Paints unveiled a 17,000 sq ft home decor studio in Chennai. This location showcases lighting, furniture, fixtures, furnishings, and home designs. [ 1 ] Asian Paints diversified its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including Sleek Kitchens and Ess Ess bath fittings. As of August 2023, the company operated 44 Beautiful Home Studios in India. Asian Paints MD & CEO Amit Syngle plans to increase Beautiful Home Studios to 65-70 in FY24. This move can help the company boost the home decor share to 8-10% of decorative revenues. Asian Paints acquired a 49% stake in lighting specialist White Teak and a 51% stake in window and door manufacturer Weatherseal in 2022. In June 2023, the company raised its stake in White Teak by 11% to 60%. Both White Teak and Weatherseal will help Asian Paints hedge risk by grabbing more opportunities in lucrative segments before competitors. The company faces stiff competition from Berger, Kansai Nerolac, AkzoNobel, Nippon Paint, Shalimar, Jotun, Snowcem, Indigo, JSW, and Sirca.

Berger Paints Year founded: 1923 Headquarter: Kolkata, India Berger is Indias second-largest paint company after Asian Paints. It offers interior and exterior paints, waterproofing solutions, wood coatings, and other specialty products across several countries. In Q1 2023, Berger Paints Nepal underperformed due to country-specific issues, but Berger Paints India reported a 40% increase in net profit. [ 3 ] Berger has a strong distribution network with over 25,000 dealers across India. As of March 2023, the company controlled 19.4%-19.5% share of Indias paints market. The paint manufacturer seeks to increase its market share to 20% in 2023. The business expanded its presence in rural areas and invested in R&D and technology to improve its distribution system and create eco-friendly products. Berger is the top competitor for Asian Paints.

Factors driving this growth include:\n\n*   **Urbanization and Infrastructure Development**: Rapid urbanization, particularly in China, India, and Southeast Asia, drives the demand for decorative and protective coatings in construction and infrastructure projects. (Source: Multiple market reports)\n*   **Shift towards Eco-Friendly Coatings**: Increasing environmental consciousness and stringent VOC emission regulations are pushing manufacturers to develop and adopt eco-friendly, water-based products.

(Source: Mordor Intelligence)\n*   **Government Initiatives**: Government investments in smart city projects and infrastructure enhancements stimulate the need for protective coatings. (Source: GlobeNewswire)\n\n**Integrated Insights and Recommendations**\n\nCombining the financial performance of Asian Paints with market trends reveals key insights and recommendations:\n\n1.  **Market Share and Competitive Positioning**: Asian Paints holds a dominant position in the Indian decorative paints market. Market reports confirm this, and it can be assumed that their extensive retail network and brand recognition contribute significantly. However, competitive intensity is rising, especially from international players and domestic firms focusing on niche segments (e.g., eco-friendly coatings).\n\n*   **Recommendation**: Continuously innovate in product offerings to maintain a competitive edge. Focus on developing high-performance, eco-friendly coatings that meet evolving customer preferences and regulatory standards.\n2.  **Revenue Diversification**: While the decorative paints segment is the primary revenue driver, the company's expansion into the home decor business presents an opportunity for diversification. The integration of White Teak revenues into the decorative business shows this transition.\n\n*   **Recommendation**: Invest in expanding the home decor business by leveraging Asian Paints' brand reputation and distribution network. Explore strategic partnerships or acquisitions to enhance product offerings in this segment.\n3.  **Profitability Optimization**: Despite healthy profit margins, external factors such as fluctuating raw material prices can impact profitability.\n\n*   **Recommendation**: Implement proactive supply chain management strategies to mitigate the impact of raw material price volatility. Consider entering long-term contracts with suppliers or diversifying the supplier base.\n4.  **Sustainability Initiatives**: The shift towards eco-friendly coatings requires companies to invest in R&D and adopt sustainable manufacturing practices.\n\n*   **Recommendation**: Enhance focus on sustainability by investing in research and development for low-VOC and bio-based coatings. Highlight sustainable practices in marketing and branding efforts to attract environmentally conscious consumers.\n5.  **International Expansion**: The international business contributes significantly to revenue, presenting growth opportunities.\n\n*   **Recommendation**: Focus on expanding operations in high-growth markets within the Asia-Pacific region. Adapt product offerings to meet local market needs and regulatory requirements.\n\n**Tables and Charts**\n\n*(Note: Due to the limitation of not being able to generate actual charts and graphs, I will describe what should be included in an ideal report.)*\n\n1.  **Revenue Contribution by Business Segment (2023-24)**\n    *   A pie chart illustrating the percentage contribution of the decorative, home decor, and international businesses to the total revenue.\n2.  **Operating and Net Profit Margin Trend (2020-2024)**\n    *   A line graph showing the trend of operating and net profit margins over the past five years.\n3.  **Asia-Pacific Paints and Coatings Market Size (2025-2030)**\n    *   A bar graph depicting the projected market size of the Asia-Pacific paints and coatings market from 2025 to 2030.\n4.  **Market Share of Key Players in the Indian Decorative Paints Market**\n    *   A bar chart or pie chart showing the market share of Asian Paints and its main competitors.\n\n**Risks and Warnings**\n\n*   **Raw Material Price Volatility**: Fluctuations in raw material prices can significantly impact profitability.

Essential inputs such as titanium dioxide, resins, acrylics, and solvents are subject to frequent price fluctuations driven by crude oil market dynamics, geopolitical instability, and global supply chain constraints.\n*   **Competitive Pressures**: Increasing competition from domestic and international players may affect market share and pricing power. Continuous innovation and differentiation are essential to maintaining a competitive advantage.\n*   **Regulatory Changes**: Changes in environmental regulations, such as VOC emission limits, may require significant investments in new technologies and product formulations.
