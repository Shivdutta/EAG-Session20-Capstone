            "detailed": "Let me think through this: Based on the input data, the user's risk appetite is 'Moderate'. According to the SIP integration policy, a 'Moderate' risk appetite corresponds to an annual return percentage of 10%. The monthly return rate is calculated by dividing the annual return rate by 12 (10%/12 = 0.833% or 0.00833).  The inflation rate is set to a default of 5.5%. The allocation policy dictates a 50/50 split between equity and debt for a moderate risk appetite. The funds provided in the previous step are allocated according to this policy.\n\nThe allocation_plan_json should reflect this 50/50 split:\n\n*   Equity: 50% allocation, Funds:\n    *   HDFC Top 100 Fund (Equity Large Cap)\n    *   ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund (Equity Large Cap)\n    *   Axis ELSS Tax Saver Fund Direct-Growth (ELSS) - Optional inclusion\n*   Debt: 50% allocation, Funds:\n    *   SBI Magnum Medium Duration Fund (Debt Medium Duration)\n    *   Axis Corporate Debt Fund (Debt Corporate Bond)\n\nThis allocation reflects the moderate risk appetite specified in the goal\\_input\\_json, aligning with the policy described in the SIP Integration Addendum.\n\nThe SIP formula is: SIP = FV\\*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV\\_inflated = FV\\*(1+i)^years\n\nConsiderations:\n\n*   The ELSS fund is marked as optional, as it is contingent on the user's tax-saving needs and preferences.\n*   The allocation can be fine-tuned based on fund-specific risk metrics and diversification considerations, which are beyond the scope of this specific agent's responsibility.\n*   This configuration assumes the inflation rate is fixed at 5.5%. If the inflation rate needs to be dynamically adjusted, further agent logic or manual user overrides may be required.",

The allocation strategy is 50% equity and 50% debt, as per the user's request and risk profile. \n\n**Equity Allocation (50%):**\nBased on the shortlisted funds from T005, the following equity funds are recommended:\n\n*   **PGIM India Flexi Cap Fund:** A flexi cap fund appearing in multiple top lists. Recommended allocation: 15% of the total portfolio. (Rationale: high-performing flexi cap fund)\n*   **HDFC Flexi Cap Fund:** A Genius Only fund on ET Money with a large fund size. Recommended allocation: 15% of the total portfolio. (Rationale: established fund with significant AUM)\n*   **PGIM India ELSS Tax Saver Fund:** An ELSS fund for tax saving under Section 80C. Recommended allocation: 10% of the total portfolio. (Rationale: tax-saving benefits)\n*   **Franklin FTSE India ETF:** An India Equity ETF. Recommended allocation: 10% of the total portfolio. (Rationale: diversified India equity exposure)\n\n**Debt Allocation (50%):**\nDue to the absence of shortlisted debt funds in T005, specific debt fund recommendations cannot be provided. The user is advised to select debt funds based on their risk tolerance and investment objectives. Consider funds from categories such as:\n\n*   Corporate Bond Funds\n*   Short Duration Funds\n*   Banking and PSU Debt Funds\n\nIt is crucial to research and select debt funds that align with the user's risk profile and investment timeline. Consult financial advisors for personalized recommendations.\n\n**SIP Context Configuration:**\n```json\n{\n  \"annual_return_pct\": 10,\n  \"monthly_return_r\": 0.008333333333333333,\n  \"inflation_pct\": 5.5,\n  \"formula_notes\": \"SIP = FV*r/((1+r)^n - 1); FV_inflated = FV*(1+i)^years\"\n}\n```\n\n**Rationale:**\n*   `annual_return_pct`: Set to 10% based on the 'Moderate' risk appetite, mapping to a 10% annual expected return.\n*   `monthly_return_r`: Calculated as `annual_return_pct/12/100` for monthly SIP calculations.\n*   `inflation_pct`: Set to the default 5.5% as the user did not override the inflation rate.\n*   `formula_notes`:  Provides the SIP and inflation-adjusted future value formulas for downstream calculations.\n",
