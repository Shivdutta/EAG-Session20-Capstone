The target annual return is set at 10%.  Standard deviation, while not explicitly provided as a fixed value in this single pass, should be considered in fund selection.  For a moderate risk profile, a balanced asset allocation strategy is recommended, typically involving a 50% allocation to equity and a 50% allocation to debt instruments. \n\nThe rationale for this allocation is as follows:\n\n*   **Risk Appetite:** A 'Moderate' risk appetite indicates a willingness to accept some level of market volatility in exchange for potentially higher returns. The 50/50 equity/debt mix reflects this balanced approach.\n*   **Time Horizon:** A 10-year time horizon provides sufficient opportunity for equity investments to generate growth, while the debt component provides stability and mitigates downside risk.\n*   **Return Objective:** The 10% annual return target is achievable with a balanced portfolio, considering historical returns of various asset classes. However, it is important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.\n\nThe standard deviation for a portfolio with this allocation can vary depending on the specific funds selected.  Equity funds typically have higher standard deviations than debt funds.  Therefore, selecting equity funds with lower volatility can help to manage the overall portfolio risk.\n\nThis configuration aligns with the common practice of allocating assets based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Regular monitoring and rebalancing of the portfolio are recommended to ensure that the asset allocation remains aligned with the investor's risk profile and investment goals. Fund selection should prioritize funds with expense ratios appropriate for the target return, and diversification across geographies and sectors within each asset class is recommended to mitigate risk.",
