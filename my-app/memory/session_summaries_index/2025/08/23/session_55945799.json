The allocation plan assigns 50% to equity and 50% to debt, corresponding to the 'Moderate' risk appetite policy.  The funds recommended are based on the risk appetite which has already been determined from the T002 output, therefore those parameters have been pre-configured for the SIP calculator in the next stage.  \n\nRationale for Allocation:\n\n*   **Equity (50%):** Aligned with the 'Moderate' risk appetite, indicating a willingness to accept some level of market fluctuation for potentially higher returns (as noted in the T002 output in the 'fund_shortlist' notes section). \n*   **Debt (50%):** Provides stability and reduces overall portfolio volatility, balancing the equity component to match the risk profile.  It is also indicated in T002 output in the 'fund_shortlist' notes section.\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\n\n*   The allocation assumes a consistent risk profile over the 10-year investment horizon.  It does not include adjustments or dynamic rebalancing strategies based on changing market conditions or evolving investor circumstances.\n*   Inflation Risk: The inflation rate is set as static, but the actual rate could vary.  \n\n**Potential Improvements**\n\n*   The rationale should explicitly link the 'Moderate' risk appetite to the specific percentages (50/50) outlined in the policy document.",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The user's risk appetite is 'Moderate,' which, according to the policy, maps to an annual return percentage of 10%. This translates to a monthly return rate (r) of 0.10/12 = 0.008333. The default inflation rate is set at 5.5% as the user did not provide an override. The allocation plan assigns 50% to equity and 50% to debt, corresponding to the 'Moderate' risk appetite policy.  The funds recommended are based on the risk appetite which has already been determined from the T002 output, therefore those parameters have been pre-configured for the SIP calculator in the next stage.  \n\nRationale for Allocation:\n\n*   **Equity (50%):** Aligned with the 'Moderate' risk appetite, indicating a willingness to accept some level of market fluctuation for potentially higher returns (as noted in the T002 output in the 'fund_shortlist' notes section). \n*   **Debt (50%):** Provides stability and reduces overall portfolio volatility, balancing the equity component to match the risk profile.  It is also indicated in T002 output in the 'fund_shortlist' notes section.\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\n\n*   The allocation assumes a consistent risk profile over the 10-year investment horizon.  It does not include adjustments or dynamic rebalancing strategies based on changing market conditions or evolving investor circumstances.\n*   Inflation Risk: The inflation rate is set as static, but the actual rate could vary.  \n\n**Potential Improvements**\n\n*   The rationale should explicitly link the 'Moderate' risk appetite to the specific percentages (50/50) outlined in the policy document.",
