Establish the core portfolio and ensure consistent investment.\n- **Mid Phase**: (Years 4-7) Continue accumulation, monitor performance against benchmarks, and begin slight de-risking if goals are significantly ahead of schedule.\n- **Final Phase**: (Years 8-10) Prioritize capital protection. Systematically shift from equity to lower-risk debt instruments to lock in gains and reduce volatility ahead of retirement.\n- **Additional Considerations**: Plan for a systematic withdrawal plan (SWP) post-retirement. Utilize tax-saving instruments like ELSS to optimize the equity portion. Ensure the debt component is finalized to maintain the moderate risk profile.\n\n## 📋 DO (STEP-BY-STEP)\n\n1. **Input Normalization** → Emit `fund_input_profile_json`\n2. **Fund Data Retrieval** → Call RetrieverAgent for goal-specific fund datasets  \n3. **Performance Analysis** → Refer \"Performance & Risk Computation\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n4. **Risk-Weighted Scoring** → Refer \"Ranking Algorithm\" from FundRecommendationAgent  \n5. **Fund Selection** → Refer \"Goal-Optimized Selection\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n6. **Output Generation** → Emit structured fund recommendation JSONs\n\n**Fund Category Guidelines for Moderate (Retirement):**\n```json\n{\n  \"category_guidelines\": {\n    \"equity_allocation\": {\n      \"core\": [\"Large & Mid Cap Funds\"],\n      \"growth_satellite\": [\"Mid Cap Funds\"],\n      \"tax_saver\": [\"ELSS Funds\"]\n    },\n    \"debt_allocation\": {\n      \"core\": [\"Corporate Bond Funds\"],\n      \"liquidity\": [\"Short Duration Funds\"]\n    },\n    \"optional_considerations\": {\n      \"alternatives\": [\"Flexi Cap Funds as a substitute for separate Large/Mid Cap funds.\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 📊 VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n**Charts for ReportGeneratorAgent:**\n- Fund Performance Chart (historical NAV)\n- Risk-Return Scatter\n- Category Allocation Breakdown\n- Expense Ratio Impact\n- Goal-Specific Timeline (glide path, liquidity, or de-risking)\n\n## 📝 SCHEMAS\n\n- **fund_input_profile_json**\n- **fund_master_json**\n- **fund_performance_json**\n- **fund_ranking_json**\n- **fund_portfolio_json**\n- **fund_analysis_json**\n\n(Use the JSON schema blocks from specialized templates as reference, swap placeholders.)\n\n## 🔄 INTEGRATION FLOW\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[SIP Retirement Analysis] --> B[Fund Input Profile]\n    B --> C[RetrieverAgent: Fund Universe]\n    C --> D[FundRecommendationAgent: 10-Year Analysis]\n    D --> E[Performance Computation]\n    E --> F[Goal-Weighted Ranking] \n    F --> G[Phase-Appropriate Portfolio]\n    G --> H[CoderAgent: Charts]\n    H --> I[ReportGeneratorAgent: Final Output]\n    I --> J[QAAgent: Validation]\n```\n\n## 📋 MANDATORY REPORT SECTIONS\n\n1.
