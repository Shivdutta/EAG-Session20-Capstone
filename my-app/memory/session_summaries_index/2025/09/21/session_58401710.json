Normalize the inputs, calculating the time horizon (9 years or 108 months). 2. Adjust the target amount (1 Crore INR) for inflation (5.5% over 9 years). 3. Calculate the required monthly SIP using the inflation-adjusted target, a moderate risk profile (10% annual return), and the 108-month horizon. 4. Define the asset allocation for a moderate profile (50% equity, 50% debt) and suggest fund categories. 5. Generate the mandatory month-by-month projection table for all 108 months using the specified compound interest algorithm.

The input data from T011 is extremely noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete. I cannot reliably calculate a composite score or rank the funds as requested because not all metrics are available for all funds. For example, Sharpe ratio is only available in one table that is missing fund names, and expense ratio is only available for one fund category. My role as DistillerAgent is to extract and structure the available signal from this noise. I will perform a best-effort extraction of fund names and any available metrics (5Y returns, Sharpe, ER) for each category. I will clearly note the data's limitations, such as cumulative vs. annualized returns and missing data points, in my output and quality assessment. The output will be a structured list of funds with their available data, which a downstream agent can then use for more advanced analysis, rather than the final ranked list the prompt asks for. This is the most honest and useful distillation I can provide given the poor quality of the input data.",

The strategy employs a Core-Satellite approach, balancing stability with growth to target the inflation-adjusted corpus of ₹1.62 Crore.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\n### **1. Investment Strategy Overview**\n\nThe primary objective is to build a corpus of ₹1,61,90,940 over a 9-year (108-month) period for a child's marriage, starting with a monthly SIP of ₹93,152. The strategy is anchored to the investor's 'moderate' risk appetite, which dictates a balanced asset allocation.\n\nThe foundational principle of this portfolio is a strategic 50% allocation to equity assets and 50% to debt assets. This balance is designed to capture the growth potential of the stock market while using the stability of fixed-income instruments to mitigate risk and provide a smoother investment journey.\n\n### **2. Portfolio Construction: A Core-Satellite Approach**\n\nTo effectively implement the 50/50 allocation, we adopt a 'Core and Satellite' model. The 'Core' portion of the portfolio is built with stable, less volatile assets that are expected to provide consistent returns. The 'Satellite' portion consists of assets with higher growth potential, which can accelerate wealth creation but come with higher risk.\n\n*   **Core Holdings (85% of Portfolio):** Comprising Large Cap Equity, Corporate Bond, and Short Duration funds, this segment is the bedrock of the investment plan, ensuring steady progress towards the goal.\n*   **Satellite Holdings (15% of Portfolio):** Consisting of the Mid Cap Equity fund, this segment is designed to generate alpha (returns above the market average) and is crucial for outpacing inflation significantly.\n\n### **3. Detailed Asset Allocation & Fund Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis, the total monthly SIP of ₹93,152 is allocated across four distinct fund categories, using specific funds from the shortlist as illustrative examples.\n\n#### **A. Equity Allocation (50% of Portfolio - ₹46,576 per month)**\n\nThe equity component is the primary engine for growth, essential for achieving the ambitious, inflation-adjusted target. It is split equally to balance stability and aggression.\n\n*   **Large Cap Fund (25% - ₹23,288/month):**\n    *   **Example Fund:** `Nippon India Large Cap Fund`\n    *   **Rationale:** Large-cap funds invest in the top 100 companies in India by market capitalization. These are established, well-researched businesses with strong financial track records. This allocation forms the stable 'core' of the equity portfolio, aiming to deliver returns in line with the broader market while containing downside risk during volatile periods.\n\n*   **Mid Cap Fund (25% - ₹23,288/month):**\n    *   **Example Fund:** `Motilal Oswal Midcap 30 Fund`\n    *   **Rationale:** Mid-cap funds invest in emerging companies that are in a high-growth phase. While more volatile than large caps, they offer significantly higher return potential over a 9-year horizon. This allocation acts as the 'satellite' component, providing the aggressive growth needed to comfortably beat education inflation and achieve the target corpus.\n\n#### **B. Debt Allocation (50% of Portfolio - ₹46,576 per month)**\n\nThe debt portion of the portfolio acts as a stabilizing anchor. Its role is to preserve capital, generate predictable income, and reduce the overall volatility of the portfolio.\n\n*   **Corporate Bond Fund (35% - ₹32,603/month):**\n    *   **Example Fund:** `ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund`\n    *   **Rationale:** These funds invest in debt securities issued by corporations. For a 9-year horizon, they offer a favorable balance of risk and reward, typically providing higher yields than government securities or short-duration funds. This forms the core of the debt portfolio, focused on generating stable, superior fixed-income returns.\n\n*   **Short Duration Fund (15% - ₹13,973/month):**\n    *   **Example Fund:** `Aditya Birla Sun Life Short Term Fund - Direct Plan`\n    *   **Rationale:** These funds invest in debt instruments with a maturity of 1 to 3 years, making them less sensitive to interest rate changes. This allocation provides liquidity and acts as a defensive cushion, ensuring a portion of the debt portfolio remains well-protected from interest rate volatility.\n\n### **4. Risk Management and Monitoring Framework**\n\nSuccessful investing requires discipline and oversight. The following framework should be adopted:\n\n*   **Diversification:** The proposed portfolio is diversified across asset classes (equity/debt), sub-categories (Large/Mid Cap), and fund houses, which is a primary tool for risk mitigation.\n*   **Annual Rebalancing:** Market movements will cause the 50/50 allocation to drift over time. It is critical to review the portfolio annually and rebalance it back to its target weights. This imposes a disciplined strategy of booking profits from outperformers and reinvesting in underperformers.\n*   **Performance Review:** While long-term focus is key, a quarterly review of fund performance against benchmarks is advisable. Consistent underperformance relative to peers for over 18-24 months may warrant a review of a specific fund.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is an illustrative strategy based on the provided inputs. The fund names are examples from a pre-defined shortlist and do not constitute direct investment advice. All mutual fund investments are subject to market risks, and investors should read the scheme documents carefully before investing.",

While the proposed strategy is designed to mitigate risk, it cannot eliminate it entirely. The primary risks include: <b>Market Risk</b>, where the value of equity investments can fluctuate significantly due to economic conditions, political events, and investor sentiment. The 9-year horizon provides time to recover from short-term downturns, but a prolonged bear market could impact the final corpus. <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> primarily affects the debt portion of the portfolio; if interest rates rise, the value (NAV) of existing bonds and bond funds may fall. The inclusion of short-duration funds helps to cushion this impact. Furthermore, <b>Credit Risk</b> is inherent in corporate bond funds, representing the possibility that a corporation may default on its debt obligations, leading to a loss of principal. Investors should favor funds that invest in high-quality, highly-rated corporate debt. Finally, <b>Inflation Risk</b> is the danger that the actual inflation rate exceeds the projected 5.5%, which would mean the final corpus has less purchasing power than intended.

The primary objective is to accumulate a target corpus of <b>₹1,00,00,000</b> over a <b>9-year (108-month)</b> period. Factoring in a conservative annual inflation rate of 5.5%, the required future value of this goal is calculated to be approximately <b>₹1.62 Crore</b>. To reach this inflation-adjusted target, a monthly SIP contribution of <b>₹93,152</b> is required, assuming a 10% annualized return consistent with the investor's 'moderate' risk profile. The investment strategy is built on a balanced <b>50% Equity and 50% Debt</b> asset allocation, employing a Core-Satellite approach to balance stable growth with wealth creation. This plan includes specific fund category recommendations, a detailed month-by-month projection, and critical risk management guidelines.</p>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"goal-inputs\">\n      <h2>📝 Goal Inputs & Parameters</h2>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Financial Goal</td><td>Child's Marriage</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Initial Target Corpus</td><td>₹1,00,00,000</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Investment Horizon</td><td>9 Years (108 Months)</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Risk Appetite</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"inflation-adjustment\">\n      <h2>💹 Inflation Adjustment</h2>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Assumed Annual Inflation Rate</td><td>5.5%</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Unadjusted Target (Today's Value)</td><td>₹1,00,00,000</td></tr>\n          <tr><td><b>Adjusted Target (Future Value)</b></td><td><b>₹1,61,90,940</b></td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"sip-calculation\">\n      <h2>🧮 Required Monthly SIP Calculation</h2>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Adjusted Target Corpus</td><td>₹1,61,90,940.35</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Expected Annual Return</td><td>10% (Moderate Risk)</td></tr>\n          <tr><td><b>Calculated Monthly SIP</b></td><td><b>₹93,151.78</b></td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Final Projected Corpus</td><td>₹1,60,42,919</td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"asset-allocation-plan\">\n      <h2>🧩 Strategic Asset Allocation Plan</h2>\n      <p>A balanced asset allocation is crucial for managing risk and achieving consistent returns.

While the proposed strategy is designed to mitigate risk, it cannot eliminate it entirely. The primary risks include: <b>Market Risk</b>, where the value of equity investments can fluctuate significantly due to economic conditions, political events, and investor sentiment. The 9-year horizon provides time to recover from short-term downturns, but a prolonged bear market could impact the final corpus. <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> primarily affects the debt portion of the portfolio; if interest rates rise, the value (NAV) of existing bonds and bond funds may fall. The inclusion of short-duration funds helps to cushion this impact. Furthermore, <b>Credit Risk</b> is inherent in corporate bond funds, representing the possibility that a corporation may default on its debt obligations, leading to a loss of principal. Investors should favor funds that invest in high-quality, highly-rated corporate debt. Finally, <b>Inflation Risk</b> is the danger that the actual inflation rate exceeds the projected 5.5%, which would mean the final corpus has less purchasing power than intended. This underscores the importance of the growth-oriented equity component in the portfolio to outpace inflation effectively.</p>\n      <blockquote>Disclaimer: This is an illustrative strategy.

The input data from T011 is extremely noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete. I cannot reliably calculate a composite score or rank the funds as requested because not all metrics are available for all funds. For example, Sharpe ratio is only available in one table that is missing fund names, and expense ratio is only available for one fund category. My role as DistillerAgent is to extract and structure the available signal from this noise. I will perform a best-effort extraction of fund names and any available metrics (5Y returns, Sharpe, ER) for each category. I will clearly note the data's limitations, such as cumulative vs. annualized returns and missing data points, in my output and quality assessment. The output will be a structured list of funds with their available data, which a downstream agent can then use for more advanced analysis, rather than the final ranked list the prompt asks for. This is the most honest and useful distillation I can provide given the poor quality of the input data.",

The strategy employs a Core-Satellite approach, balancing stability with growth to target the inflation-adjusted corpus of ₹1.62 Crore.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\n### **1. Investment Strategy Overview**\n\nThe primary objective is to build a corpus of ₹1,61,90,940 over a 9-year (108-month) period for a child's marriage, starting with a monthly SIP of ₹93,152. The strategy is anchored to the investor's 'moderate' risk appetite, which dictates a balanced asset allocation.\n\nThe foundational principle of this portfolio is a strategic 50% allocation to equity assets and 50% to debt assets. This balance is designed to capture the growth potential of the stock market while using the stability of fixed-income instruments to mitigate risk and provide a smoother investment journey.\n\n### **2. Portfolio Construction: A Core-Satellite Approach**\n\nTo effectively implement the 50/50 allocation, we adopt a 'Core and Satellite' model. The 'Core' portion of the portfolio is built with stable, less volatile assets that are expected to provide consistent returns. The 'Satellite' portion consists of assets with higher growth potential, which can accelerate wealth creation but come with higher risk.\n\n*   **Core Holdings (85% of Portfolio):** Comprising Large Cap Equity, Corporate Bond, and Short Duration funds, this segment is the bedrock of the investment plan, ensuring steady progress towards the goal.\n*   **Satellite Holdings (15% of Portfolio):** Consisting of the Mid Cap Equity fund, this segment is designed to generate alpha (returns above the market average) and is crucial for outpacing inflation significantly.\n\n### **3. Detailed Asset Allocation & Fund Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis, the total monthly SIP of ₹93,152 is allocated across four distinct fund categories, using specific funds from the shortlist as illustrative examples.\n\n#### **A. Equity Allocation (50% of Portfolio - ₹46,576 per month)**\n\nThe equity component is the primary engine for growth, essential for achieving the ambitious, inflation-adjusted target. It is split equally to balance stability and aggression.\n\n*   **Large Cap Fund (25% - ₹23,288/month):**\n    *   **Example Fund:** `Nippon India Large Cap Fund`\n    *   **Rationale:** Large-cap funds invest in the top 100 companies in India by market capitalization. These are established, well-researched businesses with strong financial track records. This allocation forms the stable 'core' of the equity portfolio, aiming to deliver returns in line with the broader market while containing downside risk during volatile periods.\n\n*   **Mid Cap Fund (25% - ₹23,288/month):**\n    *   **Example Fund:** `Motilal Oswal Midcap 30 Fund`\n    *   **Rationale:** Mid-cap funds invest in emerging companies that are in a high-growth phase. While more volatile than large caps, they offer significantly higher return potential over a 9-year horizon. This allocation acts as the 'satellite' component, providing the aggressive growth needed to comfortably beat education inflation and achieve the target corpus.\n\n#### **B. Debt Allocation (50% of Portfolio - ₹46,576 per month)**\n\nThe debt portion of the portfolio acts as a stabilizing anchor. Its role is to preserve capital, generate predictable income, and reduce the overall volatility of the portfolio.\n\n*   **Corporate Bond Fund (35% - ₹32,603/month):**\n    *   **Example Fund:** `ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund`\n    *   **Rationale:** These funds invest in debt securities issued by corporations. For a 9-year horizon, they offer a favorable balance of risk and reward, typically providing higher yields than government securities or short-duration funds. This forms the core of the debt portfolio, focused on generating stable, superior fixed-income returns.\n\n*   **Short Duration Fund (15% - ₹13,973/month):**\n    *   **Example Fund:** `Aditya Birla Sun Life Short Term Fund - Direct Plan`\n    *   **Rationale:** These funds invest in debt instruments with a maturity of 1 to 3 years, making them less sensitive to interest rate changes. This allocation provides liquidity and acts as a defensive cushion, ensuring a portion of the debt portfolio remains well-protected from interest rate volatility.\n\n### **4. Risk Management and Monitoring Framework**\n\nSuccessful investing requires discipline and oversight. The following framework should be adopted:\n\n*   **Diversification:** The proposed portfolio is diversified across asset classes (equity/debt), sub-categories (Large/Mid Cap), and fund houses, which is a primary tool for risk mitigation.\n*   **Annual Rebalancing:** Market movements will cause the 50/50 allocation to drift over time. It is critical to review the portfolio annually and rebalance it back to its target weights. This imposes a disciplined strategy of booking profits from outperformers and reinvesting in underperformers.\n*   **Performance Review:** While long-term focus is key, a quarterly review of fund performance against benchmarks is advisable. Consistent underperformance relative to peers for over 18-24 months may warrant a review of a specific fund.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is an illustrative strategy based on the provided inputs. The fund names are examples from a pre-defined shortlist and do not constitute direct investment advice. All mutual fund investments are subject to market risks, and investors should read the scheme documents carefully before investing.",

I must check the mathematical correctness of the inflation adjustment (10,000,000 * (1.055^9) = 16,190,940.35), which appears correct. Next, I'll verify the SIP calculation: using FV=16190940.35, r=0.10/12, and n=108, the SIP should be ~93,151.78. I will also confirm that the allocation percentages (equity_percent + debt_percent) in `allocation_plan_json` sum to 100. Then, I will move to T013. I need to verify that the fund portfolio (`fund_portfolio_json`) is not empty, indicating that the shortlist was used. I also need to check that the total equity and debt allocations in T013 match the strategic plan from T001 (50/50) and that the sum of the individual fund allocations equals 100.

The primary objective is to accumulate a target corpus of <b>₹1,00,00,000</b> over a <b>9-year (108-month)</b> period. Factoring in a conservative annual inflation rate of 5.5%, the required future value of this goal is calculated to be approximately <b>₹1.62 Crore</b>. To reach this inflation-adjusted target, a monthly SIP contribution of <b>₹93,152</b> is required, assuming a 10% annualized return consistent with the investor's 'moderate' risk profile. The investment strategy is built on a balanced <b>50% Equity and 50% Debt</b> asset allocation, employing a Core-Satellite approach to balance stable growth with wealth creation. This plan includes specific fund category recommendations, a detailed month-by-month projection, and critical risk management guidelines.</p><div class='table-container'><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Financial Goal</td><td>Child's Marriage</td></tr><tr><td>Initial Target Corpus</td><td>₹1,00,00,000</td></tr><tr><td>Investment Horizon</td><td>9 Years (108 Months)</td></tr><tr><td>Assumed Inflation</td><td>5.5% per annum</td></tr><tr><td><b>Inflation-Adjusted Target</b></td><td><b>₹1,61,90,940</b></td></tr><tr><td>Assumed Annual Return</td><td>10% (Moderate Risk)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Required Monthly SIP</b></td><td><b>₹93,152</b></td></tr><tr><td>Final Projected Corpus</td><td>₹1,60,42,919</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id='goal-inputs'><h2>📘 Goal Inputs & Parameters</h2><p>The foundation of this plan is based on the specific parameters provided by the user, defining the scope and objective of the investment.</p><div class='table-container'><table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Goal Type</td><td>Child Marriage</td></tr><tr><td>Target Amount</td><td>₹1,00,00,000</td></tr><tr><td>Currency</td><td>INR</td></tr><tr><td>Time Horizon</td><td>9 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Total Investment Period</td><td>108 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Risk Appetite</td><td>Moderate</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id='inflation-adjustment'><h2>💹 Inflation Adjustment</h2><p>To ensure the future value of the target corpus maintains its purchasing power, the initial goal amount has been adjusted for inflation.

The Core (85% of the portfolio: Large Cap, Corporate Bond, Short Duration) provides stability, while the Satellite (15%: Mid Cap) aims to generate alpha and accelerate corpus growth.</li><li><b>Growth & Stability in Equity:</b> The equity allocation is split equally between Large Cap and Mid Cap funds.

The Short Duration component ensures liquidity and dampens volatility.</li><li><b>AMC Diversification:</b> The illustrative portfolio diversifies across four different fund houses (Nippon India, Motilal Oswal, ICICI Prudential, Aditya Birla Sun Life), mitigating concentration risk associated with a single fund manager's style or a single AMC's performance.</li></ul></section><section id='rebalancing-guidance'><h2>🔄 Rebalancing & Monitoring Guidance</h2><p>Discipline is key to long-term investment success. Regular monitoring and rebalancing ensure the portfolio remains aligned with the original strategy.</p><ul><li><b>Frequency:</b> An annual portfolio review is recommended.</li><li><b>Trigger:</b> Rebalancing should be triggered if any asset class deviates by more than 5% from its target allocation (e.g., equity grows to 55% of the portfolio).</li><li><b>Action:</b> To rebalance, sell a portion of the outperforming asset class and reinvest the proceeds into the underperforming one. This enforces a 'buy low, sell high' discipline and manages risk drift over time.</li></ul></section><section id='risk-factors'><h2>⚠️ Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2><p>All mutual fund investments are subject to market risks, and it is crucial to understand the factors that can impact the portfolio's performance. While the proposed strategy is designed to mitigate risk, it cannot eliminate it entirely. The primary risks include: <b>Market Risk</b>, where the value of equity investments can fluctuate significantly due to economic conditions, political events, and investor sentiment. The 9-year horizon provides time to recover from short-term downturns, but a prolonged bear market could impact the final corpus. <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> primarily affects the debt portion of the portfolio; if interest rates rise, the value (NAV) of existing bonds and bond funds may fall. The inclusion of short-duration funds helps to cushion this impact. Furthermore, <b>Credit Risk</b> is inherent in corporate bond funds, representing the possibility that a corporation may default on its debt obligations, leading to a loss of principal. Investors should favor funds that invest in high-quality, highly-rated corporate debt. Finally, <b>Inflation Risk</b> is the danger that the actual inflation rate exceeds the projected 5.5%, which would mean the final corpus has less purchasing power than intended. This underscores the importance of the growth-oriented equity component in the portfolio to outpace inflation effectively.</p><blockquote>Disclaimer: This is an illustrative strategy.

Factoring in a conservative annual inflation rate of 5.5%, the required future value of this goal is calculated to be approximately <b>₹1.62 Crore</b>. To reach this inflation-adjusted target, a monthly SIP contribution of <b>₹93,152</b> is required, assuming a 10% annualized return consistent with the investor's 'moderate' risk profile. The investment strategy is built on a balanced <b>50% Equity and 50% Debt</b> asset allocation, employing a Core-Satellite approach to balance stable growth with wealth creation.

While the proposed strategy is designed to mitigate risk, it cannot eliminate it entirely. The primary risks include: <b>Market Risk</b>, where the value of equity investments can fluctuate significantly due to economic conditions, political events, and investor sentiment. The 9-year horizon provides time to recover from short-term downturns, but a prolonged bear market could impact the final corpus. <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> primarily affects the debt portion of the portfolio; if interest rates rise, the value (NAV) of existing bonds and bond funds may fall. The inclusion of short-duration funds helps to cushion this impact. Furthermore, <b>Credit Risk</b> is inherent in corporate bond funds, representing the possibility that a corporation may default on its debt obligations, leading to a loss of principal. Investors should favor funds that invest in high-quality, highly-rated corporate debt. Finally, <b>Inflation Risk</b> is the danger that the actual inflation rate exceeds the projected 5.5%, which would mean the final corpus has less purchasing power than intended. This underscores the importance of the growth-oriented equity component in the portfolio to outpace inflation effectively.</p>\n      <blockquote>Disclaimer: This is an illustrative strategy.
