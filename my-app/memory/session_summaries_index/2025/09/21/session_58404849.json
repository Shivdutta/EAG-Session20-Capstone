Utilize the full 50% equity allocation in Large and Mid-cap funds to build a strong base.\n- **Mid Phase**: Continue disciplined SIPs. Begin to monitor volatility more closely and perform annual reviews to ensure the portfolio is on track. No major de-risking yet, but prepare for it.\n- **Final Phase**: Initiate a gradual de-risking (glide path) strategy. Start shifting a portion of equity gains to lower-risk debt instruments (e.g., short-duration funds) to protect the accumulated corpus from market volatility as the goal nears.\n- **Additional Considerations**: The plan is for a significant, one-time expense. Liquidity and capital preservation become paramount in the last 2-3 years. Consider tax implications of redemption and plan accordingly.\n\n## 📋 DO (STEP-BY-STEP)\n\n1. **Input Normalization** → Emit `fund_input_profile_json`\n2. **Fund Data Retrieval** → Call RetrieverAgent for goal-specific fund datasets  \n3. **Performance Analysis** → Refer \"Performance & Risk Computation\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n4. **Risk-Weighted Scoring** → Refer \"Ranking Algorithm\" from FundRecommendationAgent  \n5. **Fund Selection** → Refer \"Goal-Optimized Selection\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n6. **Output Generation** → Emit structured fund recommendation JSONs\n\n**Fund Category Guidelines for Moderate (Child Marriage):**\n```json\n{\n  \"category_guidelines\": {\n    \"equity_allocation\": { \"categories\": [\"Large Cap Funds\", \"Mid Cap Funds\"], \"rationale\": \"Balances stability of large caps with growth potential of mid caps, suitable for a moderate risk profile over 9 years.\" },\n    \"debt_allocation\": { \"categories\": [\"Corporate Bond Funds\", \"Short Duration Funds\"], \"rationale\": \"Provides a mix of higher yield from corporate bonds and lower volatility from short-duration funds to stabilize the portfolio.\" },\n    \"optional_considerations\": { \"categories\": [\"ELSS (Equity Linked Savings Scheme)\"], \"rationale\": \"Can be integrated into the equity portion to provide tax-saving benefits under Section 80C.\" }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 📊 VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n**Charts for ReportGeneratorAgent:**\n- Fund Performance Chart (historical NAV)\n- Risk-Return Scatter\n- Category Allocation Breakdown\n- Expense Ratio Impact\n- Goal-Specific Timeline (glide path, liquidity, or de-risking)\n\n## 📝 SCHEMAS\n\n- **fund_input_profile_json**\n- **fund_master_json**\n- **fund_performance_json**\n- **fund_ranking_json**\n- **fund_portfolio_json**\n- **fund_analysis_json**\n\n(Use the JSON schema blocks from specialized templates as reference, swap placeholders.)\n\n## 🔄 INTEGRATION FLOW\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[SIP Child Marriage Analysis] --> B[Fund Input Profile]\n    B --> C[RetrieverAgent: Fund Universe]\n    C --> D[FundRecommendationAgent: 9-Year Analysis]\n    D --> E[Performance Computation]\n    E --> F[Goal-Weighted Ranking] \n    F --> G[Phase-Appropriate Portfolio]\n    G --> H[CoderAgent: Charts]\n    H --> I[ReportGeneratorAgent: Final Output]\n    I --> J[QAAgent: Validation]\n```\n\n## 📋 MANDATORY REPORT SECTIONS\n\n1.

            "detailed": "### Investment Strategy for a 9-Year Goal-Based Plan\n\n#### 1. Introduction and Objective\nThis investment strategy is engineered for a specific financial goal with a 9-year time horizon, identified as 'Child Marriage', and is aligned with a 'Moderate' risk profile. The primary objective is to accumulate the inflation-adjusted target corpus of approximately ₹1.62 Crore through a monthly SIP of ₹92,965. The strategy is built on the principles of disciplined investing, strategic asset allocation, risk management through diversification, and capital preservation as the goal nears.\n\n#### 2. Portfolio Construction & Rationale\nThe foundation of this strategy is a balanced asset allocation of 50% in Equity and 50% in Debt. This mix is designed to provide growth through equity exposure while using debt as a cushion against market volatility, which is ideal for a moderate-risk investor. The portfolio is constructed using five carefully selected mutual funds, each playing a distinct role.\n\n**Equity Allocation (50%):**\n- **Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund (25%):** This is the portfolio's anchor. Large-cap funds invest in India's most established companies, offering stability, lower volatility compared to other equity classes, and consistent long-term growth. Mirae's fund was selected for its strong performance, high ratings, and low expense ratio.\n- **Axis Midcap Fund (15%):** This is the growth engine. Mid-cap companies have higher growth potential than large-caps. This allocation acts as a satellite to the large-cap core, aiming to generate alpha and accelerate corpus growth. Axis Midcap stands out for its superior risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio of 1.25).\n- **Mirae Asset Tax Saver Fund (ELSS) (10%):** This component serves a dual purpose. It provides exposure to a diversified equity portfolio similar to a multi-cap fund while offering tax deductions up to ₹1.5 lakh annually under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Allocating ₹9,296 per month ensures substantial utilization of this tax-saving limit.\n\n**Debt Allocation (50%):**\n- **ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund (25%):** This fund invests in high-quality corporate bonds, typically offering better returns than government securities or fixed deposits. It serves as the primary return generator for the debt portion.\n- **HDFC Short Term Debt Fund (25%):** This fund provides stability and high liquidity. Its low sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations makes it a crucial component for capital preservation, a role that becomes increasingly important in the later stages of the investment horizon.\n\n#### 3. The Phased Investment Roadmap: A 9-Year Glide Path\nA static allocation is insufficient for a fixed-term goal. This strategy employs a dynamic, three-phase approach to balance growth and risk over the 9-year period.\n\n**Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1 to 4)**\n- **Objective:** Maximize capital appreciation.\n- **Action Plan:** Consistently invest the monthly SIP of ₹92,965 across the five funds as per the defined percentages. The focus during this phase is on letting the equity component compound and grow without intervention, barring annual rebalancing.\n- **Allocation:** Equity 50% / Debt 50%.\n\n**Phase 2: Consolidation & Monitoring (Years 5 to 7)**\n- **Objective:** Continue disciplined investing while closely monitoring portfolio performance against the required run rate.\n- **Action Plan:** Maintain the SIP contributions and the 50/50 asset allocation. Conduct a formal portfolio review at the end of each year. Rebalance if the asset allocation deviates by more than 5% from the target, ensuring the portfolio's risk profile remains aligned.\n- **Allocation:** Maintain Equity 50% / Debt 50%.\n\n**Phase 3: De-risking & Capital Preservation (Years 8 to 9)**\n- **Objective:** Systematically reduce risk to protect the accumulated corpus from any adverse market movements as the goal date approaches.\n- **Action Plan:** This phase involves actively shifting the portfolio's balance towards debt. This is the 'glide path'.\n- **At the beginning of Year 8:**\n  - **SIP Allocation Change:** Modify the monthly SIP instruction to direct 70% to debt funds and 30% to equity funds.\n  - **Portfolio Rebalance:** Execute a one-time switch of funds to bring the overall portfolio allocation to approximately **35% Equity and 65% Debt**.\n- **At the beginning of Year 9:**\n  - **SIP Allocation Change:** Further modify the SIP instruction to direct 90% to debt funds and 10% to equity funds.\n  - **Portfolio Rebalance:** Execute a final switch to bring the overall portfolio to **20% Equity and 80% Debt**. Within the debt portion, gradually shift assets from the Corporate Bond fund to the Short Duration fund to enhance liquidity and safety.\n\n#### 4. Rebalancing and Tax Optimization Strategy\n\n**Rebalancing Methodology:**\n- **Frequency:** Annually.\n- **Trigger:** When the actual asset allocation between equity and debt deviates from the target by more than 5% (e.g., becomes 55/45).\n- **Execution:** The preferred method is to direct future SIPs into the underweight asset class to restore balance. If this is insufficient, a partial redemption from the overweight asset class followed by an investment into the underweight one should be done. This disciplined approach prevents emotional decision-making and systematically books profits.\n\n**Tax Efficiency:**\n- **ELSS Integration:** The built-in 10% allocation to an ELSS fund helps maximize deductions under Section 80C.\n- **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** With a 9-year horizon, all equity investments will be eligible for LTCG tax. Gains up to ₹1 lakh in a financial year are tax-free. When redeeming, plan withdrawals to potentially spread them across two financial years to maximize this benefit.\n- **Debt Taxation:** Gains from debt funds held for more than three years are taxed at 20% after indexation, which is typically more efficient than the marginal slab rate taxation of fixed deposits.\n\n#### 5. Conclusion and Critical Success Factors\nThis structured and phased investment strategy provides a robust framework for achieving the specified financial goal. Its success hinges on three key factors: **Discipline** in maintaining the monthly SIPs without interruption; **Adherence** to the annual rebalancing rules; and most critically, the diligent **Execution** of the de-risking glide path in the final two years. By balancing growth with systematic risk reduction, this strategy maximizes the potential for success while safeguarding the accumulated wealth as the goal draws near.",

The core task is to structure a detailed investment plan for a 9-year goal, originally termed 'Child Marriage,' which I will neutralize to 'Child's Future Goal' for professionalism. The prompt provides a mandatory 12-section structure, which I will strictly follow. My strategy is to mine every piece of available data from the `all_globals_schema`.\n\n- **Data Sources**: T020 provides the core fund data, performance metrics, and initial recommendations. T022 offers the refined, final 5-fund portfolio, strategic rationale, and a detailed 3-phase implementation roadmap which will be the backbone of the report. T024 delivers the crucial JSON data for all required charts. T023 (QA Agent) provides critical context about a data retrieval failure (T021) and an inconsistency between T020 and T022, which I will incorporate into a 'Data Provenance & Caveats' section to demonstrate transparency and analytical rigor.\n- **Structure & Content**: I will build the report section by section, following the user's explicit list. I'll create detailed tables for the investment profile, fund performance metrics, and the final portfolio allocation. I will use the rich narrative text from T022's `final_report.detailed` to flesh out sections like Portfolio Construction, Implementation Roadmap, and Rebalancing Strategy. The Risk Analysis section will be expanded to meet the 150-word minimum by synthesizing points from T022 and adding common financial risks.\n- **Charts & Visualizations**: A key requirement is integrating the charts from T024. I will create a dedicated 'Comparison Charts' section. This will involve creating `<canvas>` elements for each chart, embedding the Chart.js library via CDN, placing the complete `fund_charts_data_json` from T024 into a `<script type='application/json'>` block, and writing a JavaScript function to parse this data and render all the charts. This ensures a dynamic and data-rich report.\n- **Consulting Polish**: I will use strong headings, bolded key metrics, bullet points, and blockquotes to improve readability. I will add sections like 'Data Provenance' and 'Key Assumptions' to mirror the thoroughness of a professional consulting document. I will also ensure all financial figures are correctly formatted.\n- **Image Search**: I have scanned all provided data structures (`T020` through `T024`) for image objects or URLs ending in common image formats. No images were found. I will include the mandatory debug section explaining this search.\n- **Final Output**: The final deliverable will be a single, minified HTML string within the required JSON structure. Given the richness of the input data, a single, exhaustive pass should be sufficient to create a high-quality report, so `call_self` will be `false`.",

The <b>Core</b> of the portfolio (50%) consists of the Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund and the ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund, providing a foundation of steady, predictable returns. The <b>Satellite</b> component (15%), represented by the Axis Midcap Fund, is designed to generate higher, alpha-driven returns. Furthermore, tax optimization is not an afterthought but is woven directly into the portfolio's fabric with a 10% allocation to the Mirae Asset Tax Saver Fund (ELSS), ensuring tax efficiency from the outset. This multi-layered diversification—across asset classes (equity/debt), sub-categories (large/mid-cap), and fund houses (Mirae, Axis, ICICI, HDFC)—creates a resilient and robust portfolio structure.</p></section><section id='risk-analysis'><h2>⚠️ Risk Analysis & Mitigation</h2><p>All investments carry inherent risks. This strategy is designed to manage and mitigate these risks through diversification and a dynamic, time-horizon-based approach. The overall portfolio volatility is expected to be moderate, significantly lower than a pure equity portfolio, due to the stabilizing effect of the 50% debt allocation.</p><ul><li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% equity allocation is exposed to market volatility. <i>Mitigation:</i> This risk is addressed through a long investment horizon of 9 years, diversification across large and mid-cap stocks, and, most importantly, the systematic de-risking glide path in years 8 and 9, which locks in gains and protects the corpus from late-stage market downturns.</li><li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Debt funds, particularly corporate bond funds, are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which can affect their NAV. <i>Mitigation:</i> The inclusion of a short-duration fund, which has very low sensitivity to rate changes, helps cushion this risk. The portfolio is diversified between two types of debt funds to balance this out.</li><li><b>Execution Risk:</b> This is a behavioral risk. The success of the glide path depends entirely on the investor's discipline to manually rebalance and shift allocations as planned in the final phase. <i>Mitigation:</i> The investor must set firm calendar reminders for the start of Year 8 and Year 9 to execute the rebalancing. Failure to de-risk is the single largest threat to the plan's success.</li><li><b>Inflation Risk:</b> The risk that investment returns will not outpace the rate of inflation, eroding the real value of the target corpus. <i>Mitigation:</i> The 50% allocation to equity is specifically designed to generate returns that comfortably beat inflation over the long term, ensuring the final corpus has the required purchasing power.</li></ul></section><section id='implementation-roadmap'><h2>🗺️ Implementation Roadmap: A 9-Year Phased Glide Path</h2><p>A static allocation is insufficient for a fixed-term goal. This strategy employs a dynamic, three-phase approach to balance growth and risk over the 9-year period.</p><h3>Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1 to 4)</h3><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Maximize capital appreciation.</li><li><b>Action Plan:</b> Consistently invest the monthly SIP of ₹92,965 across the five funds as per the defined percentages. The focus is on letting the equity component compound.</li><li><b>Allocation:</b> Maintain <b>50% Equity / 50% Debt</b>.</li></ul><h3>Phase 2: Consolidation & Monitoring (Years 5 to 7)</h3><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Continue disciplined investing and monitor portfolio performance.</li><li><b>Action Plan:</b> Maintain SIPs and the 50/50 allocation. Conduct an annual portfolio review and rebalance only if the asset allocation deviates by more than 5%.</li><li><b>Allocation:</b> Maintain <b>50% Equity / 50% Debt</b>.</li></ul><h3>Phase 3: De-risking & Capital Preservation (Years 8 to 9)</h3><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Systematically reduce risk to protect the accumulated corpus as the goal date approaches.</li><li><b>Action Plan:</b> This is the active 'glide path' phase.</li><li><b>At the start of Year 8:</b> Change SIP allocation to 30% Equity / 70% Debt. Rebalance the existing corpus to achieve an overall allocation of <b>35% Equity / 65% Debt</b>.</li><li><b>At the start of Year 9:</b> Change SIP allocation to 10% Equity / 90% Debt. Rebalance the existing corpus to a final allocation of <b>20% Equity / 80% Debt</b>, shifting towards more liquid short-term debt.</li></ul></section><section id='comparison-charts'><h2>📊 Data-Driven

the target 50/50 split by more than 5% (e.g., it becomes 56/44 or 44/56).</li><li><b>Method:</b> The preferred, most cost-effective method is to adjust the allocation of new monthly SIPs, directing more capital to the underweight asset class. If the deviation is significant, a partial redemption from the overweight asset class should be made, with the proceeds reinvested into the underweight one.</li><li><b>Glide Path Override:</b> The annual rebalancing rule is superseded by the planned glide path strategy in Years 8 and 9, which involves a deliberate and more significant shift of assets from equity to debt.</li></ul></section><section id='tax-optimization'><h2>💰 Tax Optimization</h2><p>The strategy incorporates tax efficiency at its core to maximize in-hand returns.</p><ul><li><b>ELSS Integration:</b> The 10% allocation to the Mirae Asset Tax Saver Fund (~₹1.1 lakh/year) helps utilize deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, directly reducing taxable income.</li><li><b>Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</b> Given the 9-year horizon, all equity fund redemptions will qualify for LTCG. Gains up to ₹1 lakh per financial year are tax-free, with gains above that taxed at a favorable 10%. Redemptions in the final years should be planned to potentially straddle two financial years to maximize this benefit.</li><li><b>Debt Taxation:</b> Gains from debt funds held for more than three years are taxed at 20% after indexation.

Annual reviews are key to tracking progress against an accelerated timeline.</li><li><b>Scenario 2: Market returns are lower than the assumed 10%.</b> This is a realistic possibility. Annual reviews will reveal if the portfolio is lagging its target trajectory. If so, a decision may be needed to either increase the monthly SIP amount to catch up or to adjust the final corpus expectation.</li><li><b>Scenario 3: Goal is delayed (e.g., to 10 years).</b> This provides an opportunity for additional compounding.

Aligned with a <b>Moderate risk profile</b>, the plan requires a disciplined monthly investment of <b>₹92,965.17</b> via a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). The primary objective is to accumulate an inflation-adjusted target corpus of approximately <b>₹1.62 Crore</b>. The strategy is built on a balanced asset allocation of <b>50% Equity and 50% Debt</b>, implemented through a diversified portfolio of five carefully selected mutual funds. A critical component of this strategy is a three-phase 'glide path' approach, which systematically de-risks the portfolio in the final years to preserve capital as the goal date approaches.

The <b>Core</b> of the portfolio (50%) consists of the Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund and the ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund, providing a foundation of steady, predictable returns. The <b>Satellite</b> component (15%), represented by the Axis Midcap Fund, is designed to generate higher, alpha-driven returns. Furthermore, tax optimization is not an afterthought but is woven directly into the portfolio's fabric with a 10% allocation to the Mirae Asset Tax Saver Fund (ELSS), ensuring tax efficiency from the outset. This multi-layered diversification—across asset classes (equity/debt), sub-categories (large/mid-cap), and fund houses (Mirae, Axis, ICICI, HDFC)—creates a resilient and robust portfolio structure.</p></section>\n    \n    <section id='risk-analysis'><h2>⚠️ Risk Analysis & Mitigation</h2><p>All investments carry inherent risks. This strategy is designed to manage and mitigate these risks through diversification and a dynamic, time-horizon-based approach. The overall portfolio volatility is expected to be moderate, significantly lower than a pure equity portfolio, due to the stabilizing effect of the 50% debt allocation.</p><ul><li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% equity allocation is exposed to market volatility. <i>Mitigation:</i> This risk is addressed through a long investment horizon of 9 years, diversification across large and mid-cap stocks, and, most importantly, the systematic de-risking glide path in years 8 and 9, which locks in gains and protects the corpus from late-stage market downturns.</li><li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Debt funds, particularly corporate bond funds, are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which can affect their NAV. <i>Mitigation:</i> The inclusion of a short-duration fund, which has very low sensitivity to rate changes, helps cushion this risk. The portfolio is diversified between two types of debt funds to balance this out.</li><li><b>Execution Risk:</b> This is a behavioral risk. The success of the glide path depends entirely on the investor's discipline to manually rebalance and shift allocations as planned in the final phase. <i>Mitigation:</i> The investor must set firm calendar reminders for the start of Year 8 and Year 9 to execute the rebalancing. Failure to de-risk is the single largest threat to the plan's success.</li><li><b>Inflation Risk:</b> The risk that investment returns will not outpace the rate of inflation, eroding the real value of the target corpus. <i>Mitigation:</i> The 50% allocation to equity is specifically designed to generate returns that comfortably beat inflation over the long term, ensuring the final corpus has the required purchasing power.</li></ul></section>\n    \n    <section id='implementation-roadmap'><h2>🗺️ Implementation Roadmap: A 9-Year Phased Glide Path</h2><p>A static allocation is insufficient for a fixed-term goal. This strategy employs a dynamic, three-phase approach to balance growth and risk over the 9-year period.</p><h3>Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1 to 4)</h3><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Maximize capital appreciation.</li><li><b>Action Plan:</b> Consistently invest the monthly SIP of ₹92,965 across the five funds as per the defined percentages.

Conduct an annual portfolio review and rebalance only if the asset allocation deviates by more than 5%.</li><li><b>Allocation:</b> Maintain <b>50% Equity / 50% Debt</b>.</li></ul><h3>Phase 3: De-risking & Capital Preservation (Years 8 to 9)</h3><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Systematically reduce risk to protect the accumulated corpus as the goal date approaches.</li><li><b>Action Plan:</b> This is the active 'glide path' phase.</li><li><b>At the start of Year 8:</b> Change SIP allocation to 30% Equity / 70% Debt. Rebalance the existing corpus to achieve an overall allocation of <b>35% Equity / 65% Debt</b>.</li><li><b>At the start of Year 9:</b> Change SIP allocation to 10% Equity / 90% Debt.

If the goal is prepaid, the de-risking process must be accelerated. It may result in a slightly lower corpus, as the compounding period is cut short. Annual reviews are key to tracking progress against an accelerated timeline.</li><li><b>Scenario 2: Market returns are lower than the assumed 10%.</b> This is a realistic possibility. Annual reviews will reveal if the portfolio is lagging its target trajectory. If so, a decision may be needed to either increase the monthly SIP amount to catch up or to adjust the final corpus expectation.</li><li><b>Scenario 3: Goal is delayed (e.g., to 10 years).</b> This provides an opportunity for additional compounding. The de-risking phase can be pushed back by a year, allowing the equity portion more time to grow, potentially leading to a significantly larger final corpus.</li></ul></section>\n    \n    <section id='image-search-debug'><h2>📸 Image Integration Debug Information</h2><p>As per the operational mandate, a thorough scan for images was conducted across all available data sources.

The plan includes specific rebalancing rules and tax optimization guidelines to ensure the highest probability of achieving the financial target.",
            "detailed": "### Investment Strategy for a 9-Year Goal-Based Plan\n\n#### 1. Introduction and Objective\nThis investment strategy is engineered for a specific financial goal with a 9-year time horizon, identified as 'Child Marriage', and is aligned with a 'Moderate' risk profile. The primary objective is to accumulate the inflation-adjusted target corpus of approximately ₹1.62 Crore through a monthly SIP of ₹92,965. The strategy is built on the principles of disciplined investing, strategic asset allocation, risk management through diversification, and capital preservation as the goal nears.\n\n#### 2. Portfolio Construction & Rationale\nThe foundation of this strategy is a balanced asset allocation of 50% in Equity and 50% in Debt. This mix is designed to provide growth through equity exposure while using debt as a cushion against market volatility, which is ideal for a moderate-risk investor. The portfolio is constructed using five carefully selected mutual funds, each playing a distinct role.\n\n**Equity Allocation (50%):**\n- **Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund (25%):** This is the portfolio's anchor. Large-cap funds invest in India's most established companies, offering stability, lower volatility compared to other equity classes, and consistent long-term growth. Mirae's fund was selected for its strong performance, high ratings, and low expense ratio.\n- **Axis Midcap Fund (15%):** This is the growth engine. Mid-cap companies have higher growth potential than large-caps. This allocation acts as a satellite to the large-cap core, aiming to generate alpha and accelerate corpus growth. Axis Midcap stands out for its superior risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio of 1.25).\n- **Mirae Asset Tax Saver Fund (ELSS) (10%):** This component serves a dual purpose. It provides exposure to a diversified equity portfolio similar to a multi-cap fund while offering tax deductions up to ₹1.5 lakh annually under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Allocating ₹9,296 per month ensures substantial utilization of this tax-saving limit.\n\n**Debt Allocation (50%):**\n- **ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund (25%):** This fund invests in high-quality corporate bonds, typically offering better returns than government securities or fixed deposits. It serves as the primary return generator for the debt portion.\n- **HDFC Short Term Debt Fund (25%):** This fund provides stability and high liquidity. Its low sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations makes it a crucial component for capital preservation, a role that becomes increasingly important in the later stages of the investment horizon.\n\n#### 3. The Phased Investment Roadmap: A 9-Year Glide Path\nA static allocation is insufficient for a fixed-term goal. This strategy employs a dynamic, three-phase approach to balance growth and risk over the 9-year period.\n\n**Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1 to 4)**\n- **Objective:** Maximize capital appreciation.\n- **Action Plan:** Consistently invest the monthly SIP of ₹92,965 across the five funds as per the defined percentages. The focus during this phase is on letting the equity component compound and grow without intervention, barring annual rebalancing.\n- **Allocation:** Equity 50% / Debt 50%.\n\n**Phase 2: Consolidation & Monitoring (Years 5 to 7)**\n- **Objective:** Continue disciplined investing while closely monitoring portfolio performance against the required run rate.\n- **Action Plan:** Maintain the SIP contributions and the 50/50 asset allocation. Conduct a formal portfolio review at the end of each year. Rebalance if the asset allocation deviates by more than 5% from the target, ensuring the portfolio's risk profile remains aligned.\n- **Allocation:** Maintain Equity 50% / Debt 50%.\n\n**Phase 3: De-risking & Capital Preservation (Years 8 to 9)**\n- **Objective:** Systematically reduce risk to protect the accumulated corpus from any adverse market movements as the goal date approaches.\n- **Action Plan:** This phase involves actively shifting the portfolio's balance towards debt. This is the 'glide path'.\n- **At the beginning of Year 8:**\n  - **SIP Allocation Change:** Modify the monthly SIP instruction to direct 70% to debt funds and 30% to equity funds.\n  - **Portfolio Rebalance:** Execute a one-time switch of funds to bring the overall portfolio allocation to approximately **35% Equity and 65% Debt**.\n- **At the beginning of Year 9:**\n  - **SIP Allocation Change:** Further modify the SIP instruction to direct 90% to debt funds and 10% to equity funds.\n  - **Portfolio Rebalance:** Execute a final switch to bring the overall portfolio to **20% Equity and 80% Debt**. Within the debt portion, gradually shift assets from the Corporate Bond fund to the Short Duration fund to enhance liquidity and safety.\n\n#### 4. Rebalancing and Tax Optimization Strategy\n\n**Rebalancing Methodology:**\n- **Frequency:** Annually.\n- **Trigger:** When the actual asset allocation between equity and debt deviates from the target by more than 5% (e.g., becomes 55/45).\n- **Execution:** The preferred method is to direct future SIPs into the underweight asset class to restore balance. If this is insufficient, a partial redemption from the overweight asset class followed by an investment into the underweight one should be done. This disciplined approach prevents emotional decision-making and systematically books profits.\n\n**Tax Efficiency:**\n- **ELSS Integration:** The built-in 10% allocation to an ELSS fund helps maximize deductions under Section 80C.\n- **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** With a 9-year horizon, all equity investments will be eligible for LTCG tax. Gains up to ₹1 lakh in a financial year are tax-free. When redeeming, plan withdrawals to potentially spread them across two financial years to maximize this benefit.\n- **Debt Taxation:** Gains from debt funds held for more than three years are taxed at 20% after indexation, which is typically more efficient than the marginal slab rate taxation of fixed deposits.\n\n#### 5. Conclusion and Critical Success Factors\nThis structured and phased investment strategy provides a robust framework for achieving the specified financial goal. Its success hinges on three key factors: **Discipline** in maintaining the monthly SIPs without interruption; **Adherence** to the annual rebalancing rules; and most critically, the diligent **Execution** of the de-risking glide path in the final two years. By balancing growth with systematic risk reduction, this strategy maximizes the potential for success while safeguarding the accumulated wealth as the goal draws near.",

The core task is to structure a detailed investment plan for a 9-year goal, originally termed 'Child Marriage,' which I will neutralize to 'Child's Future Goal' for professionalism. The prompt provides a mandatory 12-section structure, which I will strictly follow. My strategy is to mine every piece of available data from the `all_globals_schema`.\n\n- **Data Sources**: T020 provides the core fund data, performance metrics, and initial recommendations. T022 offers the refined, final 5-fund portfolio, strategic rationale, and a detailed 3-phase implementation roadmap which will be the backbone of the report. T024 delivers the crucial JSON data for all required charts. T023 (QA Agent) provides critical context about a data retrieval failure (T021) and an inconsistency between T020 and T022, which I will incorporate into a 'Data Provenance & Caveats' section to demonstrate transparency and analytical rigor.\n- **Structure & Content**: I will build the report section by section, following the user's explicit list. I'll create detailed tables for the investment profile, fund performance metrics, and the final portfolio allocation. I will use the rich narrative text from T022's `final_report.detailed` to flesh out sections like Portfolio Construction, Implementation Roadmap, and Rebalancing Strategy. The Risk Analysis section will be expanded to meet the 150-word minimum by synthesizing points from T022 and adding common financial risks.\n- **Charts & Visualizations**: A key requirement is integrating the charts from T024. I will create a dedicated 'Comparison Charts' section. This will involve creating `<canvas>` elements for each chart, embedding the Chart.js library via CDN, placing the complete `fund_charts_data_json` from T024 into a `<script type='application/json'>` block, and writing a JavaScript function to parse this data and render all the charts. This ensures a dynamic and data-rich report.\n- **Consulting Polish**: I will use strong headings, bolded key metrics, bullet points, and blockquotes to improve readability. I will add sections like 'Data Provenance' and 'Key Assumptions' to mirror the thoroughness of a professional consulting document. I will also ensure all financial figures are correctly formatted.\n- **Image Search**: I have scanned all provided data structures (`T020` through `T024`) for image objects or URLs ending in common image formats. No images were found. I will include the mandatory debug section explaining this search.\n- **Final Output**: The final deliverable will be a single, minified HTML string within the required JSON structure. Given the richness of the input data, a single, exhaustive pass should be sufficient to create a high-quality report, so `call_self` will be `false`.",

The <b>Core</b> of the portfolio (50%) consists of the Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund and the ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund, providing a foundation of steady, predictable returns. The <b>Satellite</b> component (15%), represented by the Axis Midcap Fund, is designed to generate higher, alpha-driven returns. Furthermore, tax optimization is not an afterthought but is woven directly into the portfolio's fabric with a 10% allocation to the Mirae Asset Tax Saver Fund (ELSS), ensuring tax efficiency from the outset. This multi-layered diversification—across asset classes (equity/debt), sub-categories (large/mid-cap), and fund houses (Mirae, Axis, ICICI, HDFC)—creates a resilient and robust portfolio structure.</p></section><section id='risk-analysis'><h2>⚠️ Risk Analysis & Mitigation</h2><p>All investments carry inherent risks. This strategy is designed to manage and mitigate these risks through diversification and a dynamic, time-horizon-based approach. The overall portfolio volatility is expected to be moderate, significantly lower than a pure equity portfolio, due to the stabilizing effect of the 50% debt allocation.</p><ul><li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% equity allocation is exposed to market volatility. <i>Mitigation:</i> This risk is addressed through a long investment horizon of 9 years, diversification across large and mid-cap stocks, and, most importantly, the systematic de-risking glide path in years 8 and 9, which locks in gains and protects the corpus from late-stage market downturns.</li><li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Debt funds, particularly corporate bond funds, are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which can affect their NAV. <i>Mitigation:</i> The inclusion of a short-duration fund, which has very low sensitivity to rate changes, helps cushion this risk. The portfolio is diversified between two types of debt funds to balance this out.</li><li><b>Execution Risk:</b> This is a behavioral risk. The success of the glide path depends entirely on the investor's discipline to manually rebalance and shift allocations as planned in the final phase. <i>Mitigation:</i> The investor must set firm calendar reminders for the start of Year 8 and Year 9 to execute the rebalancing. Failure to de-risk is the single largest threat to the plan's success.</li><li><b>Inflation Risk:</b> The risk that investment returns will not outpace the rate of inflation, eroding the real value of the target corpus. <i>Mitigation:</i> The 50% allocation to equity is specifically designed to generate returns that comfortably beat inflation over the long term, ensuring the final corpus has the required purchasing power.</li></ul></section><section id='implementation-roadmap'><h2>🗺️ Implementation Roadmap: A 9-Year Phased Glide Path</h2><p>A static allocation is insufficient for a fixed-term goal. This strategy employs a dynamic, three-phase approach to balance growth and risk over the 9-year period.</p><h3>Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1 to 4)</h3><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Maximize capital appreciation.</li><li><b>Action Plan:</b> Consistently invest the monthly SIP of ₹92,965 across the five funds as per the defined percentages. The focus is on letting the equity component compound.</li><li><b>Allocation:</b> Maintain <b>50% Equity / 50% Debt</b>.</li></ul><h3>Phase 2: Consolidation & Monitoring (Years 5 to 7)</h3><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Continue disciplined investing and monitor portfolio performance.</li><li><b>Action Plan:</b> Maintain SIPs and the 50/50 allocation. Conduct an annual portfolio review and rebalance only if the asset allocation deviates by more than 5%.</li><li><b>Allocation:</b> Maintain <b>50% Equity / 50% Debt</b>.</li></ul><h3>Phase 3: De-risking & Capital Preservation (Years 8 to 9)</h3><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Systematically reduce risk to protect the accumulated corpus as the goal date approaches.</li><li><b>Action Plan:</b> This is the active 'glide path' phase.</li><li><b>At the start of Year 8:</b> Change SIP allocation to 30% Equity / 70% Debt. Rebalance the existing corpus to achieve an overall allocation of <b>35% Equity / 65% Debt</b>.</li><li><b>At the start of Year 9:</b> Change SIP allocation to 10% Equity / 90% Debt. Rebalance the existing corpus to a final allocation of <b>20% Equity / 80% Debt</b>, shifting towards more liquid short-term debt.</li></ul></section><section id='comparison-charts'><h2>📊 Data-Driven

id='rebalancing-strategy'><h2>🔄 Rebalancing Strategy</h2><p>Disciplined rebalancing is essential to maintain the portfolio's intended risk profile over time and to systematically book profits.</p><ul><li><b>Frequency:</b> The portfolio should be reviewed annually.</li><li><b>Trigger:</b> Rebalancing is required if the actual asset allocation between Equity and Debt deviates from the target 50/50 split by more than 5% (e.g., it becomes 56/44 or 44/56).</li><li><b>Method:</b> The preferred, most cost-effective method is to adjust the allocation of new monthly SIPs, directing more capital to the underweight asset class. If the deviation is significant, a partial redemption from the overweight asset class should be made, with the proceeds reinvested into the underweight one.</li><li><b>Glide Path Override:</b> The annual rebalancing rule is superseded by the planned glide path strategy in Years 8 and 9, which involves a deliberate and more significant shift of assets from equity to debt.</li></ul></section><section id='tax-optimization'><h2>💰 Tax Optimization</h2><p>The strategy incorporates tax efficiency at its core to maximize in-hand returns.</p><ul><li><b>ELSS Integration:</b> The 10% allocation to the Mirae Asset Tax Saver Fund (~₹1.1 lakh/year) helps utilize deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, directly reducing taxable income.</li><li><b>Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</b> Given the 9-year horizon, all equity fund redemptions will qualify for LTCG. Gains up to ₹1 lakh per financial year are tax-free, with gains above that taxed at a favorable 10%. Redemptions in the final years should be planned to potentially straddle two financial years to maximize this benefit.</li><li><b>Debt Taxation:</b> Gains from debt funds held for more than three years are taxed at 20% after indexation. This is generally far more tax-efficient than Fixed Deposits, which are taxed at the investor's marginal slab rate.</li></ul></section><section id='goal-scenarios'><h2>🗓️ Goal Timeline Scenarios</h2><p>While the plan is built for a 9-year horizon, it's prudent to consider alternative scenarios.</p><ul><li><b>Scenario 1: Goal is required earlier (e.g., in 8 years).</b> This underscores the criticality of the glide path. If the goal is prepaid, the de-risking process must be accelerated. It may result in a slightly lower corpus, as the compounding period is cut short. Annual reviews are key to tracking progress against an accelerated timeline.</li><li><b>Scenario 2: Market returns are lower than the assumed 10%.</b> This is a realistic possibility. Annual reviews will reveal if the portfolio is lagging its target trajectory. If so, a decision may be needed to either increase the monthly SIP amount to catch up or to adjust the final corpus expectation.</li><li><b>Scenario 3: Goal is delayed (e.g., to 10 years).</b> This provides an opportunity for additional compounding. The de-risking phase can be pushed back by a year, allowing the equity portion more time to grow, potentially leading to a significantly larger final corpus.</li></ul></section><section id='image-search-debug'><h2>📸 Image Integration Debug Information</h2><p>As per the operational mandate, a thorough scan for images was conducted across all available data sources in the `all_globals_schema`.

The <b>Core</b> of the portfolio (50%) consists of the Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund and the ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund, providing a foundation of steady, predictable returns. The <b>Satellite</b> component (15%), represented by the Axis Midcap Fund, is designed to generate higher, alpha-driven returns. Furthermore, tax optimization is not an afterthought but is woven directly into the portfolio's fabric with a 10% allocation to the Mirae Asset Tax Saver Fund (ELSS), ensuring tax efficiency from the outset. This multi-layered diversification—across asset classes (equity/debt), sub-categories (large/mid-cap), and fund houses (Mirae, Axis, ICICI, HDFC)—creates a resilient and robust portfolio structure.</p></section>\n    \n    <section id='risk-analysis'><h2>⚠️ Risk Analysis & Mitigation</h2><p>All investments carry inherent risks. This strategy is designed to manage and mitigate these risks through diversification and a dynamic, time-horizon-based approach. The overall portfolio volatility is expected to be moderate, significantly lower than a pure equity portfolio, due to the stabilizing effect of the 50% debt allocation.</p><ul><li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% equity allocation is exposed to market volatility. <i>Mitigation:</i> This risk is addressed through a long investment horizon of 9 years, diversification across large and mid-cap stocks, and, most importantly, the systematic de-risking glide path in years 8 and 9, which locks in gains and protects the corpus from late-stage market downturns.</li><li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Debt funds, particularly corporate bond funds, are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which can affect their NAV. <i>Mitigation:</i> The inclusion of a short-duration fund, which has very low sensitivity to rate changes, helps cushion this risk. The portfolio is diversified between two types of debt funds to balance this out.</li><li><b>Execution Risk:</b> This is a behavioral risk. The success of the glide path depends entirely on the investor's discipline to manually rebalance and shift allocations as planned in the final phase. <i>Mitigation:</i> The investor must set firm calendar reminders for the start of Year 8 and Year 9 to execute the rebalancing. Failure to de-risk is the single largest threat to the plan's success.</li><li><b>Inflation Risk:</b> The risk that investment returns will not outpace the rate of inflation, eroding the real value of the target corpus. <i>Mitigation:</i> The 50% allocation to equity is specifically designed to generate returns that comfortably beat inflation over the long term, ensuring the final corpus has the required purchasing power.</li></ul></section>\n    \n    <section id='implementation-roadmap'><h2>🗺️ Implementation Roadmap: A 9-Year Phased Glide Path</h2><p>A static allocation is insufficient for a fixed-term goal. This strategy employs a dynamic, three-phase approach to balance growth and risk over the 9-year period.</p><h3>Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1 to 4)</h3><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Maximize capital appreciation.</li><li><b>Action Plan:</b> Consistently invest the monthly SIP of ₹92,965 across the five funds as per the defined percentages.

Rebalance the existing corpus to achieve an overall allocation of <b>35% Equity / 65% Debt</b>.</li><li><b>At the start of Year 9:</b> Change SIP allocation to 10% Equity / 90% Debt.

If the goal is prepaid, the de-risking process must be accelerated. It may result in a slightly lower corpus, as the compounding period is cut short. Annual reviews are key to tracking progress against an accelerated timeline.</li><li><b>Scenario 2: Market returns are lower than the assumed 10%.</b> This is a realistic possibility. Annual reviews will reveal if the portfolio is lagging its target trajectory. If so, a decision may be needed to either increase the monthly SIP amount to catch up or to adjust the final corpus expectation.</li><li><b>Scenario 3: Goal is delayed (e.g., to 10 years).</b> This provides an opportunity for additional compounding. The de-risking phase can be pushed back by a year, allowing the equity portion more time to grow, potentially leading to a significantly larger final corpus.</li></ul></section>\n    \n    <section id='image-search-debug'><h2>📸 Image Integration Debug Information</h2><p>As per the operational mandate, a thorough scan for images was conducted across all available data sources.
