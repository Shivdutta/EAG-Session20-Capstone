The 50/50 allocation should be strictly maintained, allowing the equity component to compound effectively in the initial years.\n- **Mid Phase**: (Years 4-6) Critical monitoring and rebalancing phase. Annually review the portfolio to correct any deviation from the 50/50 split, locking in equity gains if they significantly outperform.\n- **Final Phase**: (Years 7-9) Gradual de-risking and capital preservation. Begin a systematic transfer of funds (STP) from the equity component to lower-risk debt or liquid funds to protect the corpus from market volatility as the goal date approaches.\n- **Additional Considerations**: The 9-year horizon is a medium-term goal. A disciplined, emotion-free approach with annual reviews is paramount. Avoid tactical changes based on short-term market news.\n\n## 📋 DO (STEP-BY-STEP)\n\n1. **Input Normalization** → Emit `fund_input_profile_json`\n2. **Fund Data Retrieval** → Call RetrieverAgent for goal-specific fund datasets  \n3. **Performance Analysis** → Refer \"Performance & Risk Computation\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n4. **Risk-Weighted Scoring** → Refer \"Ranking Algorithm\" from FundRecommendationAgent  \n5. **Fund Selection** → Refer \"Goal-Optimized Selection\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n6. **Output Generation** → Emit structured fund recommendation JSONs\n\n**Fund Category Guidelines for Moderate (Child's Marriage):**\n```json\n{\n  \"category_guidelines\": {\n    \"equity_allocation\": {\n        \"core\": \"Large Cap / Flexi Cap Funds (for stability)\",\n        \"satellite\": \"Mid Cap Funds (for growth)\"\n    },\n    \"debt_allocation\": {\n        \"core\": \"Corporate Bond Funds (for better yield over the medium term)\",\n        \"satellite\": \"Short Duration Funds (for liquidity and lower volatility)\"\n    },\n    \"optional_considerations\": {\n        \"elss_funds\": \"Can be used to replace a portion of the equity allocation for tax-saving purposes under Section 80C, if applicable.\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 📊 VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n**Charts for ReportGeneratorAgent:**\n- Fund Performance Chart (historical NAV)\n- Risk-Return Scatter\n- Category Allocation Breakdown\n- Expense Ratio Impact\n- Goal-Specific Timeline (glide path, liquidity, or de-risking)\n\n## 📝 SCHEMAS\n\n- **fund_input_profile_json**\n- **fund_master_json**\n- **fund_performance_json**\n- **fund_ranking_json**\n- **fund_portfolio_json**\n- **fund_analysis_json**\n\n(Use the JSON schema blocks from specialized templates as reference, swap placeholders.)\n\n## 🔄 INTEGRATION FLOW\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[SIP Child's Marriage Analysis] --> B[Fund Input Profile]\n    B --> C[RetrieverAgent: Fund Universe]\n    C --> D[FundRecommendationAgent: 9-Year Analysis]\n    D --> E[Performance Computation]\n    E --> F[Goal-Weighted Ranking] \n    F --> G[Phase-Appropriate Portfolio]\n    G --> H[CoderAgent: Charts]\n    H --> I[ReportGeneratorAgent: Final Output]\n    I --> J[QAAgent: Validation]\n```\n\n## 📋 MANDATORY REPORT SECTIONS\n\n1.
