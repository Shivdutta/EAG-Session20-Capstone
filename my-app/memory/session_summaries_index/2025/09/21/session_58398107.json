Prioritize equity allocation with a mix of large and mid-cap funds to build the corpus foundation.\n- **Mid Phase**: Maintain a balanced approach. Continue SIPs while monitoring performance. Rebalance annually to maintain the 50/50 allocation.\n- **Final Phase**: Shift to capital preservation. In the final 2-3 years, systematically transfer (STP) funds from equity to debt/liquid funds to protect the accumulated corpus from market volatility.\n- **Additional Considerations**: Child education costs can be unpredictable. Annually review the target amount against prevailing education inflation and adjust the SIP if necessary. The report recommends considering an ELSS fund for tax-saving purposes within the equity portion.\n\n## 📋 DO (STEP-BY-STEP)\n\n1. **Input Normalization** → Emit `fund_input_profile_json`\n2. **Fund Data Retrieval** → Call RetrieverAgent for goal-specific fund datasets  \n3. **Performance Analysis** → Refer \"Performance & Risk Computation\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n4. **Risk-Weighted Scoring** → Refer \"Ranking Algorithm\" from FundRecommendationAgent  \n5. **Fund Selection** → Refer \"Goal-Optimized Selection\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n6. **Output Generation** → Emit structured fund recommendation JSONs\n\n**Fund Category Guidelines for Moderate (Child Education):**\n```json\n{\n  \"category_guidelines\": {\n    \"equity_allocation\": {\n      \"primary\": \"Large Cap Funds for stability and core growth.\",\n      \"secondary\": \"Mid Cap Funds to act as a growth catalyst.\"\n     },\n    \"debt_allocation\": {\n      \"primary\": \"Corporate Bond Funds for a balance of safety and yield.\",\n      \"secondary\": \"Short Duration Funds to mitigate interest rate risk.\"\n    },\n    \"optional_considerations\": {\n      \"tax_saving\": \"Consider an ELSS fund within the equity portion to utilize Section 80C benefits.\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 📊 VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n**Charts for ReportGeneratorAgent:**\n- Fund Performance Chart (historical NAV)\n- Risk-Return Scatter\n- Category Allocation Breakdown\n- Expense Ratio Impact\n- Goal-Specific Timeline (glide path, liquidity, or de-risking)\n\n## 📝 SCHEMAS\n\n- **fund_input_profile_json**\n- **fund_master_json**\n- **fund_performance_json**\n- **fund_ranking_json**\n- **fund_portfolio_json**\n- **fund_analysis_json**\n\n(Use the JSON schema blocks from specialized templates as reference, swap placeholders.)\n\n## 🔄 INTEGRATION FLOW\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[SIP Child Education Analysis] --> B[Fund Input Profile]\n    B --> C[RetrieverAgent: Fund Universe]\n    C --> D[FundRecommendationAgent: 12-Year Analysis]\n    D --> E[Performance Computation]\n    E --> F[Goal-Weighted Ranking] \n    F --> G[Phase-Appropriate Portfolio]\n    G --> H[CoderAgent: Charts]\n    H --> I[ReportGeneratorAgent: Final Output]\n    I --> J[QAAgent: Validation]\n```\n\n## 📋 MANDATORY REPORT SECTIONS\n\n1.

Your task is to process this context, define a fund screening and ranking strategy, and output structured JSONs to guide the rest of the workflow. CONTEXT DETECTION: SIP context is present. GOAL CONTEXT: Child education planning with a 12-year timeline, 'Moderate' risk tolerance, and a monthly investment capacity of 68872.93. The target is a 19,012,069 inflation-adjusted corpus. FUND SELECTION PRIORITY: Use a phased approach—focus on growth maximization (Large/Mid Cap) in the early phase, maintain a balanced approach in the mid-phase, and shift to capital preservation (debt/liquid funds) in the final 2-3 years. Consider ELSS for tax optimization. PROCESSING: (1) Ingest the provided profile. (2) Define risk-weighted scoring using the provided weights for 'Moderate' risk. (3) Establish fund category guidelines (Large Cap, Mid Cap, Corporate Bond, Short Duration, ELSS). (4) Generate initial recommendations and analysis plans. OUTPUT: Produce `fund_master_json`, `fund_screening_json`, `fund_ranking_json`, and `fund_explain_json` that reflect this specific goal. STRICT JSON only.
