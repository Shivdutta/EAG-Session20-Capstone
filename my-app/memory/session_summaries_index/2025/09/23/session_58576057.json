Prioritize equity allocation (Large & Mid Cap) to leverage compounding. Tolerate higher volatility for potential long-term gains.\n- **Mid Phase**: Years 4-7: Maintain disciplined SIPs and review portfolio performance annually. Minor rebalancing may be needed to maintain the 50/50 target allocation if one asset class significantly outperforms the other.\n- **Final Phase**: Years 8-10: Gradually de-risk by shifting a small portion of equity gains to debt if market conditions are favorable. Protect the accumulated corpus from severe market downturns as the goal approaches.\n- **Additional Considerations**: Since this is a General Wealth Creation goal without a fixed withdrawal date, the investor can remain invested or re-allocate based on new goals post the 10-year period. Liquidity is not a primary concern until the final 1-2 years.\n\n## 📋 DO (STEP-BY-STEP)\n\n1. **Input Normalization** → Emit `fund_input_profile_json`\n2. **Fund Data Retrieval** → Call RetrieverAgent for goal-specific fund datasets  \n3. **Performance Analysis** → Refer \"Performance & Risk Computation\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n4. **Risk-Weighted Scoring** → Refer \"Ranking Algorithm\" from FundRecommendationAgent  \n5. **Fund Selection** → Refer \"Goal-Optimized Selection\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n6. **Output Generation** → Emit structured fund recommendation JSONs\n\n**Fund Category Guidelines for moderate (General Wealth Creation):**\n```json\n{\n  \"category_guidelines\": {\n    \"equity_allocation\": { ... },\n    \"debt_allocation\": { ... },\n    \"optional_considerations\": { ... }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 📊 VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n**Charts for ReportGeneratorAgent:**\n- Fund Performance Chart (historical NAV)\n- Risk-Return Scatter\n- Category Allocation Breakdown\n- Expense Ratio Impact\n- Goal-Specific Timeline (glide path, liquidity, or de-risking)\n\n## 📝 SCHEMAS\n\n- **fund_input_profile_json**\n- **fund_master_json**\n- **fund_performance_json**\n- **fund_ranking_json**\n- **fund_portfolio_json**\n- **fund_analysis_json**\n\n(Use the JSON schema blocks from specialized templates as reference, swap placeholders.)\n\n## 🔄 INTEGRATION FLOW\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[SIP General Wealth Creation Analysis] --> B[Fund Input Profile]\n    B --> C[RetrieverAgent: Fund Universe]\n    C --> D[FundRecommendationAgent: 10-Year Analysis]\n    D --> E[Performance Computation]\n    E --> F[Goal-Weighted Ranking] \n    F --> G[Phase-Appropriate Portfolio]\n    G --> H[CoderAgent: Charts]\n    H --> I[ReportGeneratorAgent: Final Output]\n    I --> J[QAAgent: Validation]\n```\n\n## 📋 MANDATORY REPORT SECTIONS\n\n1.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\n### 1. Executive Summary\n\nThis document details a comprehensive 10-year investment strategy designed for the goal of 'General Wealth Creation' for an investor with a moderate risk appetite. The plan is structured around a disciplined Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of ₹83,387 per month. The strategy is dynamic and adapts over the investment horizon, divided into three distinct phases: an initial **Growth Phase (Years 1-3)**, a mid-term **Consolidation Phase (Years 4-7)**, and a final **Capital Preservation Phase (Years 8-10)**. The initial asset allocation is an equal split of 50% in equity mutual funds and 50% in debt mutual funds. The portfolio is constructed using five carefully selected, top-rated funds that offer a blend of growth potential and stability. The strategy includes a clear methodology for annual rebalancing and a pre-defined glide path for de-risking in the final years to safeguard the accumulated corpus. Additionally, it provides actionable guidance on tax optimization to enhance net returns.\n\n### 2. Portfolio Construction & Fund Selection Rationale\n\nThe initial portfolio is built on a 50% Equity and 50% Debt allocation, reflecting the moderate risk profile. This balance aims to capture the long-term growth potential of equities while using the stability of debt to mitigate volatility. The total monthly investment of ₹83,387 is split as ₹41,694 into equity and ₹41,693 into debt.\n\n**Equity Allocation (50% of Portfolio):**\nThe equity component is diversified across market capitalizations to optimize the risk-return trade-off.\n- **Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund (20%):** As the core equity holding, its flexi-cap mandate allows the fund manager to invest across large, mid, and small-cap stocks, and also includes exposure to international equities. This provides diversification and adaptability to changing market conditions.\n- **Axis Midcap Fund (15%):** This fund is included to act as a growth kicker. Mid-cap companies have the potential for higher growth than large-caps, making them suitable for a long-term goal like wealth creation.\n- **Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund (15%):** This provides a stable foundation to the equity portfolio by investing in well-established, blue-chip companies, which tend to be less volatile than smaller companies.\n\n**Debt Allocation (50% of Portfolio):**\nThe debt component is designed to provide stability, regular income, and capital preservation.\n- **HDFC Corporate Bond Fund (25%):** This fund invests in high-quality corporate bonds, aiming for returns through interest accrual. It offers a better return potential than traditional safe-haven assets with relatively low credit risk.\n- **ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund (25%):** With a lower duration profile, this fund is less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. It provides liquidity and stability to the debt portion of the portfolio.\n\n### 3. The Three-Phase Strategic Roadmap\n\n**Phase I: Growth & Accumulation (Years 1-3)**\n- **Objective:** Maximize capital appreciation through the power of compounding.\n- **Strategy:** Maintain the initial 50% Equity and 50% Debt allocation. The focus is on disciplined execution of the monthly SIPs, irrespective of market conditions, to benefit from rupee cost averaging. Volatility during this phase is an opportunity, as it allows for the purchase of more units when prices are low. No rebalancing is typically required unless an extreme market movement causes a deviation of over 10% from the target allocation.\n\n**Phase II: Consolidation & Rebalancing (Years 4-7)**\n- **Objective:** Continue wealth accumulation while actively managing risk by maintaining the strategic asset allocation.\n- **Strategy:** The 50/50 Equity/Debt split remains the target. The portfolio will be reviewed on an annual basis. \n- **Rebalancing Rule:** If, at the time of the annual review, the actual asset allocation has deviated from the 50/50 target by more than 5% (e.g., the portfolio is now 56% equity and 44% debt), a rebalancing action is triggered. This is done by selling a portion of the outperforming asset class and buying the underperforming one to return to the 50/50 split. This process enforces a disciplined 'buy low, sell high' strategy and controls portfolio risk.\n\n**Phase III: Capital Preservation & De-risking (Years 8-10)**\n- **Objective:** Systematically reduce risk to protect the accumulated corpus from market shocks as the 10-year goal approaches.\n- **Strategy:** The strategic asset allocation will be intentionally and gradually shifted away from equity and towards debt. This 'glide path' ensures that a sudden market crash in the final years does not significantly erode the portfolio's value.\n- **De-risking Glide Path:** The target allocation will be adjusted at the start of each year as follows:\n  - **Start of Year 8:** Target Allocation shifts to **45% Equity / 55% Debt**.\n  - **Start of Year 9:** Target Allocation shifts to **40% Equity / 60% Debt**.\n  - **Start of Year 10:** Target Allocation shifts to **35% Equity / 65% Debt**.\n\nThese shifts should be executed via systematic switches from the equity funds to the existing debt funds (or a lower-risk liquid fund if preferred).\n\n### 4. Tax Optimization Strategy\n\nEffective tax management is crucial for maximizing the in-hand returns.\n- **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** All equity fund investments should ideally be held for more than 12 months. Any gains realized from selling equity units after this period will be classified as LTCG and taxed at 10% on gains exceeding ₹1 lakh in a financial year. Rebalancing transactions in later years should be planned to minimize this tax impact.\n- **Debt Taxation:** Gains from debt funds are taxed based on the holding period. For this 10-year plan, most holdings will qualify for long-term treatment (held >36 months), where gains are taxed at 20% after the benefit of indexation, which adjusts the purchase price for inflation, often resulting in a lower effective tax rate.\n- **Optional ELSS Integration:** The investor can consider replacing one of the equity funds (e.g., the large-cap or a portion of the flexi-cap) with an Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) fund. This would allow for a tax deduction of up to ₹1.5 lakhs annually under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. However, this introduces a 3-year lock-in period for each SIP installment, which is manageable within a 10-year horizon.\n\n### 5. Monitoring Framework\n\nA 'set and forget' approach is not advisable. A disciplined monitoring framework should be established.\n- **Quarterly Review:** A brief review of the portfolio's performance against benchmarks every three months to ensure the funds are performing as expected. No action is typically needed.\n- **Annual Strategic Review:** A detailed review at the end of each investment year. This is the point to check the asset allocation against the target for that year and execute rebalancing or de-risking actions as per the plan.\n\nThis structured, phase-based approach provides a robust framework to navigate market cycles over the next decade, balancing the need for growth with the imperative of capital protection to achieve the goal of wealth creation.",

I will create a new 'Goal Timeline Scenarios' section from scratch to fulfill the requirements. The most complex part is integrating the interactive charts from T024. I will create a dedicated 'Comparison Charts' section with multiple canvas elements and embed the Chart.js library along with the data from T024's JSON output. This will involve writing the necessary JavaScript to parse the JSON and render five distinct charts: Performance Comparison, Risk-Return Scatter, Portfolio Allocation (two charts), Expense Ratios, and the Asset Allocation Glide Path. I will also explicitly mention the data retrieval failure from T021 in the Risk Analysis section to be transparent about data limitations, as a high-quality report should.

Executive Summary</h2><p>This report details a comprehensive 10-year investment strategy designed for the goal of <b>'General Wealth Creation'</b> for an investor with a moderate risk appetite. The plan is structured around a disciplined Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of <b>₹83,387 per month</b>. The strategy is dynamic and adapts over the investment horizon, divided into three distinct phases: an initial <b>Growth & Accumulation Phase (Years 1-3)</b>, a mid-term <b>Consolidation & Rebalancing Phase (Years 4-7)</b>, and a final <b>Capital Preservation & De-risking Phase (Years 8-10)</b>. The initial asset allocation is an equal split of 50% in equity mutual funds and 50% in debt mutual funds, constructed using five carefully selected, top-rated funds. The strategy includes a clear methodology for annual rebalancing, a pre-defined glide path for de-risking in the final years to safeguard the accumulated corpus, and actionable guidance on tax optimization to enhance net returns.</p></section><section id='investment-profile'><h2>2.

Portfolio Construction</h2><p>The portfolio is constructed using a <b>Core-Satellite approach</b> to balance stability with growth potential.</p><ul><li><b>Equity Rationale (50%):</b> The equity basket combines a stable core (<b>Mirae Asset Large Cap</b>) with growth-oriented satellites (<b>Axis Midcap</b>, <b>Parag Parikh Flexi Cap</b>). This diversifies across market caps and management styles, aligning with the moderate risk profile for long-term compounding. The Parag Parikh fund also adds an element of international diversification.</li><li><b>Debt Rationale (50%):</b> The debt portion is built for stability and predictable returns. <b>HDFC Corporate Bond Fund</b> targets high-quality corporate debt for accrual, while <b>ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund</b> offers lower duration risk and liquidity, creating a balanced and stable foundation for the portfolio.</li></ul></section><section id='risk-analysis'><h2>7. Risk Analysis</h2><p>All investments carry inherent risks. This portfolio's moderate risk profile is exposed to several key factors that must be understood and monitored. The strategy is designed to mitigate these risks over the long term, but cannot eliminate them.</p><ul><li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% initial equity exposure will be subject to market volatility. Stock market declines are an expected part of investing. The disciplined SIP approach is a key mitigator, as it allows for purchasing more units when prices are low (rupee cost averaging). However, a significant downturn, especially in the later years of the plan, could impact the final corpus. The de-risking glide path is designed specifically to reduce this risk as the goal approaches.</li><li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> The debt funds, particularly the HDFC Corporate Bond Fund, are sensitive to changes in benchmark interest rates. A rising rate environment could lead to temporary mark-to-market losses on the fund's NAV. The inclusion of a short-duration fund helps to cushion this impact, as it is less sensitive to rate changes.</li><li><b>Concentration Risk:</b> While diversified across five funds, the portfolio's performance is still predominantly tied to the Indian economic and market cycles. The Parag Parikh Flexi Cap fund provides some international diversification, which helps mitigate this risk to a small degree.</li><li><b>Fund Manager Risk:</b> The performance of actively managed funds is dependent on the skill of the fund management team. A change in manager or a period of underperformance relative to the benchmark is a possibility. Regular annual reviews will help monitor this.</li></ul><div class='callout warning'>⚠️ <b>Data Limitation Notice:</b> During the automated data gathering phase for this report (Step T021), the live data retrieval agent encountered an error and failed to pull the latest fund details and portfolio holdings. The analysis and recommendations in this report are therefore based on the validated, high-quality data from our internal database (Step T020). While this data is robust, it may not reflect the most recent day-to-day changes in fund statistics.</div></section><section id='implementation-roadmap'><h2>8. Implementation Roadmap</h2><p>A structured, phase-based approach provides a robust framework to navigate market cycles over the next decade. The strategy is divided into three distinct phases:</p><ol><li><b>Phase I: Growth & Accumulation (Years 1-3)</b><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Maximize capital appreciation through disciplined investing.</li><li><b>Strategy:</b> Maintain the initial 50% Equity / 50% Debt allocation. The focus is on executing the monthly SIPs without fail, irrespective of market conditions, to benefit from rupee cost averaging.</li></ul></li><li><b>Phase II: Consolidation & Rebalancing (Years 4-7)</b><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Continue wealth accumulation while actively managing risk.</li><li><b>Strategy:</b> The 50/50 Equity/Debt split remains the target. The portfolio will be reviewed annually and rebalanced if the allocation deviates by more than 5% from the target.</li></ul></li><li><b>Phase III: Capital Preservation & De-risking (Years 8-10)</b><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Systematically reduce risk to protect the accumulated corpus.</li><li><b>Strategy:</b> The strategic asset allocation will be intentionally shifted towards debt according to the pre-defined glide path outlined in the Rebalancing section.</li></ul></li></ol></section><section id='comparison-charts'><h2>9.

Tax Optimization</h2><p>Effective tax management is crucial for maximizing in-hand returns.</p><ul><li><b>Equity Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</b> Equity fund investments should be held for more than one year. Gains on selling units after this period are taxed at 10% on gains exceeding ₹1 lakh in a financial year. Rebalancing transactions should be planned to minimize this tax.</li><li><b>Debt Taxation:</b> For a 10-year plan, most debt fund holdings will qualify for long-term treatment (held >3 years). Gains are taxed at 20% after the benefit of indexation, which adjusts the purchase price for inflation, often resulting in a lower effective tax rate.</li><li><b>Optional ELSS Integration:</b> To gain tax benefits under Section 80C, a portion of the equity investment (up to ₹1.5 lakh annually) could be routed through an Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) fund. This introduces a 3-year lock-in for each SIP, which is manageable within a 10-year horizon.</li></ul></section><section id='timeline-scenarios'><h2>12.

Follow the SIP schedule, annual rebalancing, and de-risking glide path without deviation.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Bull Market Scenario</b> (Above-Average Returns)</td><td>Markets perform exceptionally well, leading to higher-than-projected returns. The target corpus might be reached before the 10-year mark.</td><td>Consider de-risking earlier than planned. One could begin the glide path in Year 6 or 7 to lock in gains and protect the achieved goal. Do not get greedy and increase equity exposure.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Bear Market Scenario</b> (Below-Average Returns)</td><td>A prolonged market downturn results in lower returns, especially if it occurs in the early-to-mid phase of the plan.</td><td>This is the most critical time to remain disciplined. Continue SIPs to buy more units at lower prices (rupee cost averaging). A downturn in the early years is an opportunity. If a downturn persists into the final years, one might need to consider extending the investment horizon by 1-2 years to allow for market recovery.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js'></script><script id='chart-data' type='application/json'>{\"performance_comparison\":{\"type\":\"bar\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Parag Parikh Flexi Cap\",\"Axis Midcap\",\"Mirae Asset Large Cap\",\"HDFC Corporate Bond\",\"ICICI Prudential ST\"],\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"1Y CAGR (%)\",\"data\":[22,24,19,7,6.8],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.6)\"},{\"label\":\"3Y CAGR (%)\",\"data\":[25,26,21,7.5,7.2],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.6)\"},{\"label\":\"5Y CAGR (%)\",\"data\":[21,22,18,8,7.5],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.6)\"}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":false}},\"scales\":{\"y\":{\"beginAtZero\":true,\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Annualized Return (%)\"}}}}},\"risk_return_scatter\":{\"type\":\"scatter\",\"data\":{\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"Equity Funds\",\"data\":[{\"x\":0.17,\"y\":25,\"fundName\":\"Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund\"},{\"x\":0.19,\"y\":26,\"fundName\":\"Axis Midcap Fund\"},{\"x\":0.15,\"y\":21,\"fundName\":\"Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund\"}],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.8)\"},{\"label\":\"Debt Funds\",\"data\":[{\"x\":0.03,\"y\":7.5,\"fundName\":\"HDFC Corporate Bond Fund\"},{\"x\":0.025,\"y\":7.2,\"fundName\":\"ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund\"}],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.8)\"}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":false},\"tooltip\":{\"callbacks\":{\"label\":function(context){return context.raw.fundName + ': (Risk: ' + context.raw.x + ', Return: ' + context.raw.y + '%)';}}}},\"scales\":{\"x\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Risk (Standard Deviation)\"}},\"y\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Return (3Y CAGR %)\"}}}}},\"portfolio_allocation\":{\"asset_class\":{\"type\":\"doughnut\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Equity\",\"Debt\"],\"datasets\":[{\"data\":[50,50],\"backgroundColor\":[\"#3B82F6\",\"#10B981\"]}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":false}}}},\"fund_level\":{\"type\":\"pie\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Parag Parikh Flexi Cap\",\"Axis Midcap\",\"Mirae Asset Large Cap\",\"HDFC Corporate Bond\",\"ICICI Prudential ST\"],\"datasets\":[{\"data\":[20,15,15,25,25],\"backgroundColor\":[\"#3B82F6\",\"#60A5FA\",\"#93C5FD\",\"#10B981\",\"#34D399\"]}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":false}}}}},\"expense_ratio_comparison\":{\"type\":\"bar\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Parag Parikh Flexi Cap\",\"Axis Midcap\",\"Mirae Asset Large Cap\",\"HDFC Corporate Bond\",\"ICICI Prudential ST\"],\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"Expense Ratio (%)\",\"data\":[0.76,0.52,0.54,0.35,0.38],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.6)\"}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":false}},\"scales\":{\"y\":{\"beginAtZero\":true,\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Expense Ratio (%)\"}}}}},\"glide_path\":{\"type\":\"line\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Year 1\",\"Year 2\",\"Year 3\",\"Year 4\",\"Year 5\",\"Year 6\",\"Year 7\",\"Year 8\",\"Year 9\",\"Year 10\"],\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"Equity Allocation (%)\",\"data\":[50,50,50,50,50,50,50,45,40,35],\"borderColor\":\"#3B82F6\",\"tension\":0.1,\"fill\":false},{\"label\":\"Debt Allocation (%)\",\"data\":[50,50,50,50,50,50,50,55,60,65],\"borderColor\":\"#10B981\",\"tension\":0.1,\"fill\":false}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":false}},\"scales\":{\"y\":{\"min\":0,\"max\":100,\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Allocation (%)\"}}}}}}</script><script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){try{const chartData=JSON.parse(document.getElementById('chart-data').textContent);new Chart(document.getElementById('performanceChart').getContext('2d'),chartData.performance_comparison);new Chart(document.getElementById('riskReturnChart').getContext('2d'),chartData.risk_return_scatter);new Chart(document.getElementById('assetAllocationChart').getContext('2d'),chartData.portfolio_allocation.asset_class);new Chart(document.getElementById('fundAllocationChart').getContext('2d'),chartData.portfolio_allocation.fund_level);new Chart(document.getElementById('expenseRatioChart').getContext('2d'),chartData.expense_ratio_comparison);new Chart(document.getElementById('glidePathChart').getContext('2d'),chartData.glide_path);}catch(e){console.error('Error rendering charts:',e);}});</script></div>"

Executive Summary</h2>\n        <p>This report details a comprehensive 10-year investment strategy designed for the goal of <b>'General Wealth Creation'</b> for an investor with a moderate risk appetite. The plan is structured around a disciplined Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of <b>₹83,387 per month</b>. The strategy is dynamic and adapts over the investment horizon, divided into three distinct phases: an initial <b>Growth & Accumulation Phase (Years 1-3)</b>, a mid-term <b>Consolidation & Rebalancing Phase (Years 4-7)</b>, and a final <b>Capital Preservation & De-risking Phase (Years 8-10)</b>. The initial asset allocation is an equal split of 50% in equity mutual funds and 50% in debt mutual funds, constructed using five carefully selected, top-rated funds. The strategy includes a clear methodology for annual rebalancing, a pre-defined glide path for de-risking in the final years to safeguard the accumulated corpus, and actionable guidance on tax optimization to enhance net returns.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"investment-profile\">\n        <h2>2.

Portfolio Construction</h2>\n        <p>The portfolio is constructed using a <b>Core-Satellite approach</b> to balance stability with growth potential.</p><ul><li><b>Equity Rationale (50%):</b> The equity basket combines a stable core (<b>Mirae Asset Large Cap</b>) with growth-oriented satellites (<b>Axis Midcap</b>, <b>Parag Parikh Flexi Cap</b>).

Risk Analysis</h2>\n        <p>All investments carry inherent risks. This portfolio's moderate risk profile is exposed to several key factors that must be understood and monitored. The strategy is designed to mitigate these risks over the long term, but cannot eliminate them.</p><ul><li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% initial equity exposure will be subject to market volatility. Stock market declines are an expected part of investing. The disciplined SIP approach is a key mitigator, as it allows for purchasing more units when prices are low (rupee cost averaging). However, a significant downturn, especially in the later years of the plan, could impact the final corpus. The de-risking glide path is designed specifically to reduce this risk as the goal approaches.</li><li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> The debt funds, particularly the HDFC Corporate Bond Fund, are sensitive to changes in benchmark interest rates. A rising rate environment could lead to temporary mark-to-market losses on the fund's NAV. The inclusion of a short-duration fund helps to cushion this impact, as it is less sensitive to rate changes.</li><li><b>Concentration Risk:</b> While diversified across five funds, the portfolio's performance is still predominantly tied to the Indian economic and market cycles. The Parag Parikh Flexi Cap fund provides some international diversification, which helps mitigate this risk to a small degree.</li><li><b>Fund Manager Risk:</b> The performance of actively managed funds is dependent on the skill of the fund management team. A change in manager or a period of underperformance relative to the benchmark is a possibility. Regular annual reviews will help monitor this.</li></ul>\n        <div class='callout warning'>⚠️ <b>Data Limitation Notice:</b> During the automated data gathering phase for this report (Step T021), the live data retrieval agent encountered an error and failed to pull the latest fund details and portfolio holdings.

Tax Optimization</h2>\n        <p>Effective tax management is crucial for maximizing in-hand returns.</p><ul><li><b>Equity Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</b> Equity fund investments should be held for more than one year. Gains on selling units after this period are taxed at 10% on gains exceeding ₹1 lakh in a financial year. Rebalancing transactions should be planned to minimize this tax.</li><li><b>Debt Taxation:</b> For a 10-year plan, most debt fund holdings will qualify for long-term treatment (held >3 years). Gains are taxed at 20% after the benefit of indexation, which adjusts the purchase price for inflation, often resulting in a lower effective tax rate.</li><li><b>Optional ELSS Integration:</b> To gain tax benefits under Section 80C, a portion of the equity investment (up to ₹1.5 lakh annually) could be routed through an Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) fund.

The plan is structured around a disciplined Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of ₹83,387 per month. The strategy is dynamic and adapts over the investment horizon, divided into three distinct phases: an initial **Growth Phase (Years 1-3)**, a mid-term **Consolidation Phase (Years 4-7)**, and a final **Capital Preservation Phase (Years 8-10)**. The initial asset allocation is an equal split of 50% in equity mutual funds and 50% in debt mutual funds. The portfolio is constructed using five carefully selected, top-rated funds that offer a blend of growth potential and stability. The strategy includes a clear methodology for annual rebalancing and a pre-defined glide path for de-risking in the final years to safeguard the accumulated corpus. Additionally, it provides actionable guidance on tax optimization to enhance net returns.\n\n### 2. Portfolio Construction & Fund Selection Rationale\n\nThe initial portfolio is built on a 50% Equity and 50% Debt allocation, reflecting the moderate risk profile. This balance aims to capture the long-term growth potential of equities while using the stability of debt to mitigate volatility. The total monthly investment of ₹83,387 is split as ₹41,694 into equity and ₹41,693 into debt.\n\n**Equity Allocation (50% of Portfolio):**\nThe equity component is diversified across market capitalizations to optimize the risk-return trade-off.\n- **Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund (20%):** As the core equity holding, its flexi-cap mandate allows the fund manager to invest across large, mid, and small-cap stocks, and also includes exposure to international equities. This provides diversification and adaptability to changing market conditions.\n- **Axis Midcap Fund (15%):** This fund is included to act as a growth kicker. Mid-cap companies have the potential for higher growth than large-caps, making them suitable for a long-term goal like wealth creation.\n- **Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund (15%):** This provides a stable foundation to the equity portfolio by investing in well-established, blue-chip companies, which tend to be less volatile than smaller companies.\n\n**Debt Allocation (50% of Portfolio):**\nThe debt component is designed to provide stability, regular income, and capital preservation.\n- **HDFC Corporate Bond Fund (25%):** This fund invests in high-quality corporate bonds, aiming for returns through interest accrual. It offers a better return potential than traditional safe-haven assets with relatively low credit risk.\n- **ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund (25%):** With a lower duration profile, this fund is less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. It provides liquidity and stability to the debt portion of the portfolio.\n\n### 3. The Three-Phase Strategic Roadmap\n\n**Phase I: Growth & Accumulation (Years 1-3)**\n- **Objective:** Maximize capital appreciation through the power of compounding.\n- **Strategy:** Maintain the initial 50% Equity and 50% Debt allocation. The focus is on disciplined execution of the monthly SIPs, irrespective of market conditions, to benefit from rupee cost averaging. Volatility during this phase is an opportunity, as it allows for the purchase of more units when prices are low. No rebalancing is typically required unless an extreme market movement causes a deviation of over 10% from the target allocation.\n\n**Phase II: Consolidation & Rebalancing (Years 4-7)**\n- **Objective:** Continue wealth accumulation while actively managing risk by maintaining the strategic asset allocation.\n- **Strategy:** The 50/50 Equity/Debt split remains the target. The portfolio will be reviewed on an annual basis. \n- **Rebalancing Rule:** If, at the time of the annual review, the actual asset allocation has deviated from the 50/50 target by more than 5% (e.g., the portfolio is now 56% equity and 44% debt), a rebalancing action is triggered. This is done by selling a portion of the outperforming asset class and buying the underperforming one to return to the 50/50 split. This process enforces a disciplined 'buy low, sell high' strategy and controls portfolio risk.\n\n**Phase III: Capital Preservation & De-risking (Years 8-10)**\n- **Objective:** Systematically reduce risk to protect the accumulated corpus from market shocks as the 10-year goal approaches.\n- **Strategy:** The strategic asset allocation will be intentionally and gradually shifted away from equity and towards debt. This 'glide path' ensures that a sudden market crash in the final years does not significantly erode the portfolio's value.\n- **De-risking Glide Path:** The target allocation will be adjusted at the start of each year as follows:\n  - **Start of Year 8:** Target Allocation shifts to **45% Equity / 55% Debt**.\n  - **Start of Year 9:** Target Allocation shifts to **40% Equity / 60% Debt**.\n  - **Start of Year 10:** Target Allocation shifts to **35% Equity / 65% Debt**.\n\nThese shifts should be executed via systematic switches from the equity funds to the existing debt funds (or a lower-risk liquid fund if preferred).\n\n### 4. Tax Optimization Strategy\n\nEffective tax management is crucial for maximizing the in-hand returns.\n- **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** All equity fund investments should ideally be held for more than 12 months. Any gains realized from selling equity units after this period will be classified as LTCG and taxed at 10% on gains exceeding ₹1 lakh in a financial year. Rebalancing transactions in later years should be planned to minimize this tax impact.\n- **Debt Taxation:** Gains from debt funds are taxed based on the holding period. For this 10-year plan, most holdings will qualify for long-term treatment (held >36 months), where gains are taxed at 20% after the benefit of indexation, which adjusts the purchase price for inflation, often resulting in a lower effective tax rate.\n- **Optional ELSS Integration:** The investor can consider replacing one of the equity funds (e.g., the large-cap or a portion of the flexi-cap) with an Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) fund. This would allow for a tax deduction of up to ₹1.5 lakhs annually under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. However, this introduces a 3-year lock-in period for each SIP installment, which is manageable within a 10-year horizon.\n\n### 5. Monitoring Framework\n\nA 'set and forget' approach is not advisable. A disciplined monitoring framework should be established.\n- **Quarterly Review:** A brief review of the portfolio's performance against benchmarks every three months to ensure the funds are performing as expected. No action is typically needed.\n- **Annual Strategic Review:** A detailed review at the end of each investment year. This is the point to check the asset allocation against the target for that year and execute rebalancing or de-risking actions as per the plan.\n\nThis structured, phase-based approach provides a robust framework to navigate market cycles over the next decade, balancing the need for growth with the imperative of capital protection to achieve the goal of wealth creation.",

I will create a new 'Goal Timeline Scenarios' section from scratch to fulfill the requirements. The most complex part is integrating the interactive charts from T024. I will create a dedicated 'Comparison Charts' section with multiple canvas elements and embed the Chart.js library along with the data from T024's JSON output. This will involve writing the necessary JavaScript to parse the JSON and render five distinct charts: Performance Comparison, Risk-Return Scatter, Portfolio Allocation (two charts), Expense Ratios, and the Asset Allocation Glide Path.

Executive Summary</h2><p>This report details a comprehensive 10-year investment strategy designed for the goal of <b>'General Wealth Creation'</b> for an investor with a moderate risk appetite. The plan is structured around a disciplined Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of <b>₹83,387 per month</b>. The strategy is dynamic and adapts over the investment horizon, divided into three distinct phases: an initial <b>Growth & Accumulation Phase (Years 1-3)</b>, a mid-term <b>Consolidation & Rebalancing Phase (Years 4-7)</b>, and a final <b>Capital Preservation & De-risking Phase (Years 8-10)</b>. The initial asset allocation is an equal split of 50% in equity mutual funds and 50% in debt mutual funds, constructed using five carefully selected, top-rated funds. The strategy includes a clear methodology for annual rebalancing, a pre-defined glide path for de-risking in the final years to safeguard the accumulated corpus, and actionable guidance on tax optimization to enhance net returns.</p></section><section id='investment-profile'><h2>2.

Portfolio Construction</h2><p>The portfolio is constructed using a <b>Core-Satellite approach</b> to balance stability with growth potential.</p><ul><li><b>Equity Rationale (50%):</b> The equity basket combines a stable core (<b>Mirae Asset Large Cap</b>) with growth-oriented satellites (<b>Axis Midcap</b>, <b>Parag Parikh Flexi Cap</b>). This diversifies across market caps and management styles, aligning with the moderate risk profile for long-term compounding. The Parag Parikh fund also adds an element of international diversification.</li><li><b>Debt Rationale (50%):</b> The debt portion is built for stability and predictable returns. <b>HDFC Corporate Bond Fund</b> targets high-quality corporate debt for accrual, while <b>ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund</b> offers lower duration risk and liquidity, creating a balanced and stable foundation for the portfolio.</li></ul></section><section id='risk-analysis'><h2>7. Risk Analysis</h2><p>All investments carry inherent risks. This portfolio's moderate risk profile is exposed to several key factors that must be understood and monitored. The strategy is designed to mitigate these risks over the long term, but cannot eliminate them.</p><ul><li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% initial equity exposure will be subject to market volatility. Stock market declines are an expected part of investing. The disciplined SIP approach is a key mitigator, as it allows for purchasing more units when prices are low (rupee cost averaging). However, a significant downturn, especially in the later years of the plan, could impact the final corpus. The de-risking glide path is designed specifically to reduce this risk as the goal approaches.</li><li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> The debt funds, particularly the HDFC Corporate Bond Fund, are sensitive to changes in benchmark interest rates. A rising rate environment could lead to temporary mark-to-market losses on the fund's NAV. The inclusion of a short-duration fund helps to cushion this impact, as it is less sensitive to rate changes.</li><li><b>Concentration Risk:</b> While diversified across five funds, the portfolio's performance is still predominantly tied to the Indian economic and market cycles. The Parag Parikh Flexi Cap fund provides some international diversification, which helps mitigate this risk to a small degree.</li><li><b>Fund Manager Risk:</b> The performance of actively managed funds is dependent on the skill of the fund management team. A change in manager or a period of underperformance relative to the benchmark is a possibility. Regular annual reviews will help monitor this.</li></ul><div class='callout warning'>⚠️ <b>Data Limitation Notice:</b> During the automated data gathering phase for this report (Step T021), the live data retrieval agent encountered an error and failed to pull the latest fund details and portfolio holdings.

Implementation Roadmap</h2><p>A structured, phase-based approach provides a robust framework to navigate market cycles over the next decade. The strategy is divided into three distinct phases:</p><ol><li><b>Phase I: Growth & Accumulation (Years 1-3)</b><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Maximize capital appreciation through disciplined investing.</li><li><b>Strategy:</b> Maintain the initial 50% Equity / 50% Debt allocation. The focus is on executing the monthly SIPs without fail, irrespective of market conditions, to benefit from rupee cost averaging.</li></ul></li><li><b>Phase II: Consolidation & Rebalancing (Years 4-7)</b><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Continue wealth accumulation while actively managing risk.</li><li><b>Strategy:</b> The 50/50 Equity/Debt split remains the target. The portfolio will be reviewed annually and rebalanced if the allocation deviates by more than 5% from the target.</li></ul></li><li><b>Phase III: Capital Preservation & De-risking (Years 8-10)</b><ul><li><b>Objective:</b> Systematically reduce risk to protect the accumulated corpus.</li><li><b>Strategy:</b> The strategic asset allocation will be intentionally shifted towards debt according to the pre-defined glide path outlined in the Rebalancing section.</li></ul></li></ol></section><section id='comparison-charts'><h2>9.

The portfolio should be reviewed annually.</p><p><b>Rebalancing Rule:</b> A rebalancing action is triggered if, at the time of the annual review, the actual asset allocation has deviated from the target for that year by more than 5% (e.g., the portfolio becomes 56% equity when the target is 50%). Rebalancing involves selling the outperforming asset and buying the underperforming one to restore the target balance.</p><h4>10-Year Asset Allocation Glide Path</h4><p>The following table outlines the planned de-risking of the portfolio in its final years.</p><div class='table-container'><table><thead><tr><th>Investment Year</th><th>Phase</th><th>Target Equity %</th><th>Target Debt %</th><th>Key Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Years 1-3</td><td>Growth & Accumulation</td><td>50%</td><td>50%</td><td>Disciplined SIP execution.

Tax Optimization</h2><p>Effective tax management is crucial for maximizing in-hand returns.</p><ul><li><b>Equity Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</b> Equity fund investments should be held for more than one year. Gains on selling units after this period are taxed at 10% on gains exceeding ₹1 lakh in a financial year. Rebalancing transactions should be planned to minimize this tax.</li><li><b>Debt Taxation:</b> For a 10-year plan, most debt fund holdings will qualify for long-term treatment (held >3 years). Gains are taxed at 20% after the benefit of indexation, which adjusts the purchase price for inflation, often resulting in a lower effective tax rate.</li><li><b>Optional ELSS Integration:</b> To gain tax benefits under Section 80C, a portion of the equity investment (up to ₹1.5 lakh annually) could be routed through an Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) fund. This introduces a 3-year lock-in for each SIP, which is manageable within a 10-year horizon.</li></ul></section><section id='timeline-scenarios'><h2>12.

The target corpus might be reached before the 10-year mark.</td><td>Consider de-risking earlier than planned.

Portfolio Construction</h2>\n        <p>The portfolio is constructed using a <b>Core-Satellite approach</b> to balance stability with growth potential.</p><ul><li><b>Equity Rationale (50%):</b> The equity basket combines a stable core (<b>Mirae Asset Large Cap</b>) with growth-oriented satellites (<b>Axis Midcap</b>, <b>Parag Parikh Flexi Cap</b>). This diversifies across market caps and management styles, aligning with the moderate risk profile for long-term compounding. The Parag Parikh fund also adds an element of international diversification.</li><li><b>Debt Rationale (50%):</b> The debt portion is built for stability and predictable returns. <b>HDFC Corporate Bond Fund</b> targets high-quality corporate debt for accrual, while <b>ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund</b> offers lower duration risk and liquidity, creating a balanced and stable foundation for the portfolio.</li></ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"risk-analysis\">\n        <h2>7. Risk Analysis</h2>\n        <p>All investments carry inherent risks. This portfolio's moderate risk profile is exposed to several key factors that must be understood and monitored. The strategy is designed to mitigate these risks over the long term, but cannot eliminate them.</p><ul><li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% initial equity exposure will be subject to market volatility. Stock market declines are an expected part of investing. The disciplined SIP approach is a key mitigator, as it allows for purchasing more units when prices are low (rupee cost averaging). However, a significant downturn, especially in the later years of the plan, could impact the final corpus. The de-risking glide path is designed specifically to reduce this risk as the goal approaches.</li><li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> The debt funds, particularly the HDFC Corporate Bond Fund, are sensitive to changes in benchmark interest rates. A rising rate environment could lead to temporary mark-to-market losses on the fund's NAV. The inclusion of a short-duration fund helps to cushion this impact, as it is less sensitive to rate changes.</li><li><b>Concentration Risk:</b> While diversified across five funds, the portfolio's performance is still predominantly tied to the Indian economic and market cycles. The Parag Parikh Flexi Cap fund provides some international diversification, which helps mitigate this risk to a small degree.</li><li><b>Fund Manager Risk:</b> The performance of actively managed funds is dependent on the skill of the fund management team. A change in manager or a period of underperformance relative to the benchmark is a possibility. Regular annual reviews will help monitor this.</li></ul>\n        <div class='callout warning'>⚠️ <b>Data Limitation Notice:</b> During the automated data gathering phase for this report (Step T021), the live data retrieval agent encountered an error and failed to pull the latest fund details and portfolio holdings.

Tax Optimization</h2>\n        <p>Effective tax management is crucial for maximizing in-hand returns.</p><ul><li><b>Equity Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</b> Equity fund investments should be held for more than one year. Gains on selling units after this period are taxed at 10% on gains exceeding ₹1 lakh in a financial year. Rebalancing transactions should be planned to minimize this tax.</li><li><b>Debt Taxation:</b> For a 10-year plan, most debt fund holdings will qualify for long-term treatment (held >3 years). Gains are taxed at 20% after the benefit of indexation, which adjusts the purchase price for inflation, often resulting in a lower effective tax rate.</li><li><b>Optional ELSS Integration:</b> To gain tax benefits under Section 80C, a portion of the equity investment (up to ₹1.5 lakh annually) could be routed through an Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) fund.
