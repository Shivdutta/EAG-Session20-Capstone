Rebalance annually to maintain the 50/50 split if deviation exceeds +/- 5%.\n- **Final Phase**: Years 8-10: Prioritize capital preservation. Consider a slight shift within the debt allocation towards shorter duration funds to minimize interest rate risk as the retirement goal approaches.\n- **Additional Considerations**: The primary focus is meeting the corpus target.

The strategy includes a detailed glide path for de-risking, a disciplined rebalancing methodology, and tax optimization guidelines. CRITICAL NOTE: Due to a data retrieval failure, this strategy uses placeholder funds; actual fund selection is a mandatory next step.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\n### 1. Investment Strategy Overview\n\nThis investment strategy is tailored for a 50-year-old investor with a 'Moderate' risk appetite aiming to build a retirement corpus over a 10-year time horizon. The plan is based on a required monthly SIP of ₹83,388. The foundational principle is a balanced asset allocation of 50% in equity for growth and 50% in debt for stability and capital preservation. This approach is designed to generate inflation-beating returns while managing downside risk, which becomes increasingly important as the retirement goal nears.\n\n**CRITICAL CAVEAT:** The preceding data retrieval step (T021) failed to fetch real-world fund data. Consequently, this entire report is a **strategic blueprint**. The funds mentioned are placeholders representing their respective categories. Before any investment is made, a rigorous selection process based on the screening criteria from T020 must be completed to choose specific, high-quality mutual funds.\n\n### 2. Portfolio Construction & Rationale\n\nThe portfolio is diversified across four key mutual fund categories to achieve its risk-return objectives:\n\n*   **Equity Allocation (50% of SIP - ₹41,694/month):**\n    *   **Large Cap Equity (25%):** This forms the core of the equity portfolio. Investing in India's largest and most stable companies provides a foundation of consistent, albeit moderate, growth with lower volatility compared to the broader market.\n    *   **Mid Cap Equity (25%):** This is the growth satellite of the portfolio. Mid-cap companies offer higher growth potential and are essential for driving the portfolio's overall returns to meet the target corpus. This component is expected to have higher volatility, which is managed by the portfolio's other defensive holdings.\n\n*   **Debt Allocation (50% of SIP - ₹41,694/month):**\n    *   **Corporate Bond Debt (25%):** These funds invest in debt issued by corporations and typically offer higher yields than government securities. They provide a stable income stream and act as a cushion during periods of equity market decline.\n    *   **Short Duration Debt (25%):** This component is the portfolio's defensive anchor. By investing in debt instruments with short maturities, these funds have very low sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, prioritizing capital protection and liquidity.\n\n### 3. Phased Implementation Strategy (The Glide Path)\n\nA static allocation is insufficient for a goal-based plan. This strategy incorporates a 'glide path' to systematically de-risk the portfolio as the 10-year goal approaches.\n\n*   **Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1-3)**\n    *   **Allocation:** Maintain the initial 50/50 Equity-Debt split (25% in each of the four categories).\n    *   **Focus:** The primary goal is disciplined accumulation through uninterrupted monthly SIPs. The 25% Mid Cap allocation is key to maximizing growth in these early years.\n\n*   **Phase 2: Monitoring & Rebalancing (Years 4-7)**\n    *   **Allocation:** Continue with the 50/50 target allocation.\n    *   **Focus:** Maintain investment discipline. The key activity in this phase is annual portfolio rebalancing. This ensures the portfolio's risk profile does not drift from its 'Moderate' target due to market movements.\n\n*   **Phase 3: Capital Preservation (Years 8-10)**\n    *   **Allocation:** Implement a systematic annual de-risking by shifting assets from higher-risk to lower-risk categories.\n    *   **Focus:** The priority shifts from aggressive growth to protecting the accumulated corpus.\n    *   **Year 8:** Shift 5% of the total portfolio from Mid Cap to Large Cap, and 5% from Corporate Bond to Short Duration. (New target: 30% Large Cap, 20% Mid Cap, 20% Corp Bond, 30% Short Duration).\n    *   **Year 9:** Repeat the shift. (New target: 35% Large Cap, 15% Mid Cap, 15% Corp Bond, 35% Short Duration).\n    *   **Year 10:** Repeat the final shift. (Final target: 40% Large Cap, 10% Mid Cap, 10% Corp Bond, 40% Short Duration). This significantly reduces the portfolio's sensitivity to market volatility in the final year before retirement.\n\n### 4. Rebalancing Methodology\n\nRebalancing is a crucial discipline to manage risk and maintain the strategic asset allocation.\n\n*   **Review Cadence:** The portfolio should be reviewed annually on a fixed date.\n*   **Deviation Trigger:** A rebalancing action is required if the actual allocation of either Equity or Debt has drifted by more than +/- 5% from the 50% target. For example, if a strong equity market pushes the equity allocation to 56% of the portfolio's value.\n*   **Execution:** The preferred method is to direct future SIPs into the underweight asset class. If the deviation is large, a portion of the overweight asset class should be sold and reinvested into the underweight one, keeping tax implications in mind.\n\n### 5. Tax Optimization Strategies\n\nGiven the 10-year horizon, tax efficiency is paramount.\n\n*   **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** All equity fund investments will be held for more than one year, qualifying them for LTCG tax treatment. Gains up to ₹1 lakh per financial year are tax-free, and gains above this are taxed at 10%.\n*   **Tax Harvesting:** During rebalancing, if selling is required, consider 'harvesting' gains up to the ₹1 lakh tax-free limit annually, if it aligns with the rebalancing need. This can help reset the cost basis and reduce future tax liability.\n*   **Debt Taxation:** Gains from debt funds held for more than three years are taxed at 20% after indexation, which adjusts the purchase price for inflation, thereby reducing the real taxable gain. The 10-year horizon ensures most debt holdings will receive this benefit upon redemption.",

CRITICAL NOTE: Due to a data retrieval failure, this strategy uses placeholder funds; actual fund selection is a mandatory next step.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\n### 1. Investment Strategy Overview\n\nThis investment strategy is tailored for a 50-year-old investor with a 'Moderate' risk appetite aiming to build a retirement corpus over a 10-year time horizon. The plan is based on a required monthly SIP of ₹83,388. The foundational principle is a balanced asset allocation of 50% in equity for growth and 50% in debt for stability and capital preservation. This approach is designed to generate inflation-beating returns while managing downside risk, which becomes increasingly important as the retirement goal nears.\n\n**CRITICAL CAVEAT:** The preceding data retrieval step (T021) failed to fetch real-world fund data. Consequently, this entire report is a **strategic blueprint**. The funds mentioned are placeholders representing their respective categories. Before any investment is made, a rigorous selection process based on the screening criteria from T020 must be completed to choose specific, high-quality mutual funds.\n\n### 2. Portfolio Construction & Rationale\n\nThe portfolio is diversified across four key mutual fund categories to achieve its risk-return objectives:\n\n*   **Equity Allocation (50% of SIP - ₹41,694/month):**\n    *   **Large Cap Equity (25%):** This forms the core of the equity portfolio. Investing in India's largest and most stable companies provides a foundation of consistent, albeit moderate, growth with lower volatility compared to the broader market.\n    *   **Mid Cap Equity (25%):** This is the growth satellite of the portfolio. Mid-cap companies offer higher growth potential and are essential for driving the portfolio's overall returns to meet the target corpus. This component is expected to have higher volatility, which is managed by the portfolio's other defensive holdings.\n\n*   **Debt Allocation (50% of SIP - ₹41,694/month):**\n    *   **Corporate Bond Debt (25%):** These funds invest in debt issued by corporations and typically offer higher yields than government securities. They provide a stable income stream and act as a cushion during periods of equity market decline.\n    *   **Short Duration Debt (25%):** This component is the portfolio's defensive anchor. By investing in debt instruments with short maturities, these funds have very low sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, prioritizing capital protection and liquidity.\n\n### 3. Phased Implementation Strategy (The Glide Path)\n\nA static allocation is insufficient for a goal-based plan. This strategy incorporates a 'glide path' to systematically de-risk the portfolio as the 10-year goal approaches.\n\n*   **Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1-3)**\n    *   **Allocation:** Maintain the initial 50/50 Equity-Debt split (25% in each of the four categories).\n    *   **Focus:** The primary goal is disciplined accumulation through uninterrupted monthly SIPs. The 25% Mid Cap allocation is key to maximizing growth in these early years.\n\n*   **Phase 2: Monitoring & Rebalancing (Years 4-7)**\n    *   **Allocation:** Continue with the 50/50 target allocation.\n    *   **Focus:** Maintain investment discipline. The key activity in this phase is annual portfolio rebalancing. This ensures the portfolio's risk profile does not drift from its 'Moderate' target due to market movements.\n\n*   **Phase 3: Capital Preservation (Years 8-10)**\n    *   **Allocation:** Implement a systematic annual de-risking by shifting assets from higher-risk to lower-risk categories.\n    *   **Focus:** The priority shifts from aggressive growth to protecting the accumulated corpus.\n    *   **Year 8:** Shift 5% of the total portfolio from Mid Cap to Large Cap, and 5% from Corporate Bond to Short Duration. (New target: 30% Large Cap, 20% Mid Cap, 20% Corp Bond, 30% Short Duration).\n    *   **Year 9:** Repeat the shift. (New target: 35% Large Cap, 15% Mid Cap, 15% Corp Bond, 35% Short Duration).\n    *   **Year 10:** Repeat the final shift. (Final target: 40% Large Cap, 10% Mid Cap, 10% Corp Bond, 40% Short Duration). This significantly reduces the portfolio's sensitivity to market volatility in the final year before retirement.\n\n### 4. Rebalancing Methodology\n\nRebalancing is a crucial discipline to manage risk and maintain the strategic asset allocation.\n\n*   **Review Cadence:** The portfolio should be reviewed annually on a fixed date.\n*   **Deviation Trigger:** A rebalancing action is required if the actual allocation of either Equity or Debt has drifted by more than +/- 5% from the 50% target. For example, if a strong equity market pushes the equity allocation to 56% of the portfolio's value.\n*   **Execution:** The preferred method is to direct future SIPs into the underweight asset class. If the deviation is large, a portion of the overweight asset class should be sold and reinvested into the underweight one, keeping tax implications in mind.\n\n### 5. Tax Optimization Strategies\n\nGiven the 10-year horizon, tax efficiency is paramount.\n\n*   **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** All equity fund investments will be held for more than one year, qualifying them for LTCG tax treatment. Gains up to ₹1 lakh per financial year are tax-free, and gains above this are taxed at 10%.\n*   **Tax Harvesting:** During rebalancing, if selling is required, consider 'harvesting' gains up to the ₹1 lakh tax-free limit annually, if it aligns with the rebalancing need. This can help reset the cost basis and reduce future tax liability.\n*   **Debt Taxation:** Gains from debt funds held for more than three years are taxed at 20% after indexation, which adjusts the purchase price for inflation, thereby reducing the real taxable gain. The 10-year horizon ensures most debt holdings will receive this benefit upon redemption.",

My checklist includes mathematical accuracy, risk profile alignment, goal alignment, data integrity, and the inclusion of critical requirements like rebalancing and tax strategies. A quick scan reveals that T021, the data retrieval step, failed completely, returning only error messages. This is the most critical issue. T022 correctly identifies this failure and adapts by creating a strategic blueprint with placeholder funds, which is a commendable recovery attempt. I will verify the math and logic in T020 and T022, but the primary finding will be the critical failure in T021 that halts the entire process.",
