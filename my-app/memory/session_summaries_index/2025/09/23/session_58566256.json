Prioritize alpha generation from Mid Cap funds, supported by the stability of Large Cap funds.\n- **Mid Phase**: Years 4-7: Maintain strict adherence to the 50/50 allocation. Conduct annual reviews and rebalance to ensure the portfolio remains aligned with the target risk profile and captures gains.\n- **Final Phase**: Years 8-10: Implement a gradual de-risking strategy. Systematically shift a portion of the equity allocation (primarily from Mid Cap) to the debt side to protect the accumulated corpus from market volatility as the retirement date nears.\n- **Additional Considerations**: Given the investor's age, capital preservation is paramount in the final years. The plan must include a clear withdrawal strategy post-retirement. Tax implications of rebalancing and redemption must be factored in.\n\n## 📋 DO (STEP-BY-STEP)\n\n1. **Input Normalization** → Emit `fund_input_profile_json`\n2. **Fund Data Retrieval** → Call RetrieverAgent for goal-specific fund datasets  \n3. **Performance Analysis** → Refer \"Performance & Risk Computation\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n4. **Risk-Weighted Scoring** → Refer \"Ranking Algorithm\" from FundRecommendationAgent  \n5. **Fund Selection** → Refer \"Goal-Optimized Selection\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n6. **Output Generation** → Emit structured fund recommendation JSONs\n\n**Fund Category Guidelines for Moderate (Retirement):**\n```json\n{\n  \"category_guidelines\": {\n    \"equity_allocation\": {\n        \"percentage\": 50,\n        \"categories\": [\n            {\"type\": \"Large Cap Funds\", \"rationale\": \"Forms the stable core of the equity portfolio, investing in established companies for consistent, long-term growth.\"},\n            {\"type\": \"Mid Cap Funds\", \"rationale\": \"Acts as a growth catalyst, investing in emerging companies with high potential for superior returns over a 10-year horizon.\"}\n        ]\n    },\n    \"debt_allocation\": {\n        \"percentage\": 50,\n        \"categories\": [\n            {\"type\": \"Corporate Bond Funds\", \"rationale\": \"Provides higher yield compared to government securities, offering a balance of regular income and portfolio stability.\"},\n            {\"type\": \"Short Duration Funds\", \"rationale\": \"Serves as a defensive stabilizer, minimizing interest rate risk and protecting capital, crucial as retirement approaches.\"}\n        ]\n    },\n    \"optional_considerations\": {\n        \"notes\": \"Diversification across 2-3 funds within each recommended category is advised to mitigate fund-specific risk.\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 📊 VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n**Charts for ReportGeneratorAgent:**\n- Fund Performance Chart (historical NAV)\n- Risk-Return Scatter\n- Category Allocation Breakdown\n- Expense Ratio Impact\n- Goal-Specific Timeline (glide path, liquidity, or de-risking)\n\n## 📝 SCHEMAS\n\n- **fund_input_profile_json**\n- **fund_master_json**\n- **fund_performance_json**\n- **fund_ranking_json**\n- **fund_portfolio_json**\n- **fund_analysis_json**\n\n(Use the JSON schema blocks from specialized templates as reference, swap placeholders.)\n\n## 🔄 INTEGRATION FLOW\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[SIP Retirement Analysis] --> B[Fund Input Profile]\n    B --> C[RetrieverAgent: Fund Universe]\n    C --> D[FundRecommendationAgent: 10-Year Analysis]\n    D --> E[Performance Computation]\n    E --> F[Goal-Weighted Ranking] \n    F --> G[Phase-Appropriate Portfolio]\n    G --> H[CoderAgent: Charts]\n    H --> I[ReportGeneratorAgent: Final Output]\n    I --> J[QAAgent: Validation]\n```\n\n## 📋 MANDATORY REPORT SECTIONS\n\n1.

            "detailed": "### **1. Executive Summary**\nThis document outlines a detailed, goal-oriented investment strategy designed to build a retirement corpus of approximately â‚¹1.7 Crore over a 10-year period through a monthly SIP of â‚¹83,388. The strategy is tailored for an investor with a 'Moderate' risk profile. The core of the plan is a dynamic, three-phased asset allocation model that prioritizes growth in the early years and systematically shifts focus to capital preservation as the retirement date approaches. The portfolio is constructed using four highly-rated mutual funds: Parag Parikh Flexi Cap, Quant Mid Cap, HDFC Corporate Bond, and ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund, starting with a balanced 50% allocation to equity and 50% to debt.\n\n### **2. Investment Profile & Goal Alignment**\n- **Goal:** Retirement Planning\n- **Time Horizon:** 10 Years\n- **Risk Profile:** Moderate\n- **Monthly SIP:** â‚¹83,388\n- **Target Corpus (Inflation-Adjusted):** â‚¹1,70,81,445\n\nThe strategy directly aligns with these parameters by creating a portfolio that balances growth potential with risk management. The 10-year horizon is sufficient to absorb equity market volatility, while the moderate risk profile is reflected in the foundational 50/50 asset split.\n\n### **3. The 3-Phase Portfolio Progression: A Dynamic Glide Path Strategy**\nThe cornerstone of this strategy is its time-segmented approach, ensuring the portfolio's risk profile evolves appropriately as the goal nears.\n\n**Phase 1: Accumulation & Growth (Years 1-3)**\n- **Objective:** To maximize capital appreciation by leveraging the full time horizon.\n- **Rationale:** During this phase, the focus is on accumulating units and allowing the power of compounding to work, especially in the growth-oriented portion of the portfolio.\n- **Allocation Strategy:**\n  - **Total Equity: 50%**\n    - Parag Parikh Flexi Cap (Large Cap): 25% (â‚¹20,847/month)\n    - Quant Mid Cap Fund (Mid Cap): 25% (â‚¹20,847/month)\n  - **Total Debt: 50%**\n    - HDFC Corporate Bond Fund: 25% (â‚¹20,847/month)\n    - ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund: 25% (â‚¹20,847/month)\n\n**Phase 2: Consolidation & Rebalancing (Years 4-7)**\n- **Objective:** To maintain the strategic asset allocation and lock in gains.\n- **Rationale:** As the corpus grows, preventing significant deviation from the target risk profile becomes critical. This phase emphasizes discipline.\n- **Allocation Strategy:** The target allocation remains 50% Equity and 50% Debt. An annual review is conducted. If market movements cause the split to deviate (e.g., equity grows to 57% and debt shrinks to 43%), action is taken to bring it back to the 50/50 target. This disciplined selling of outperforming assets and buying of underperforming ones is a proven risk management technique.\n\n**Phase 3: Capital Preservation & De-risking (Years 8-10)**\n- **Objective:** To systematically reduce portfolio risk and protect the accumulated capital from market volatility.\n- **Rationale:** A significant market downturn just before retirement can be devastating. This phase involves a pre-defined, gradual shift from the most volatile asset class (Mid Cap Equity) to a more stable one (Corporate Bond Debt).\n- **Glide Path Allocation Targets:**\n  - **At the start of Year 8:** Shift allocation to **Equity 45% / Debt 55%**. (Reduce Quant Mid Cap to 20%, Increase HDFC Corporate Bond to 30%).\n  - **At the start of Year 9:** Shift allocation to **Equity 40% / Debt 60%**. (Reduce Quant Mid Cap to 15%, Increase HDFC Corporate Bond to 35%).\n  - **At the start of Year 10:** Final target allocation of **Equity 35% / Debt 65%**. (Reduce Parag Parikh Flexi to 20%, hold Quant Mid Cap at 15%, Increase HDFC Corporate Bond to 40%).\nThis structured de-risking ensures a smoother journey towards the target corpus in the final, most critical years.\n\n### **4. Implementation Roadmap & Monitoring Framework**\n1.  **Initial Setup (Month 1):** Open accounts with the respective AMCs or through a centralized platform. Set up four monthly SIPs for â‚¹20,847 each in the recommended funds.\n2.  **Ongoing Investment (Months 2-84):** Continue the monthly SIPs as per the Phase 1 & 2 allocation. Do not react to short-term market noise. Focus on the long-term goal.\n3.  **Annual Review:** At the end of each investment year, review the portfolio's overall asset allocation. Rebalance if the equity/debt split has deviated by more than 5% from the target.\n4.  **Execute De-risking (Years 8, 9, 10):** At the beginning of years 8, 9, and 10, execute the planned rebalancing to meet the glide path targets. This may involve redirecting SIPs and/or selling some equity units to buy debt units.\n\n### **5. Tax Optimization Strategy**\n- **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** All equity fund units should ideally be held for more than one year. When rebalancing requires selling, prioritize selling units that have been held for over 12 months to qualify for the lower LTCG tax rate. Gains up to â‚¹1 lakh per financial year are tax-free.\n- **ELSS Consideration:** The investor should assess their Section 80C tax-saving needs. If there is available capacity, a portion of the investment in the Parag Parikh Flexi Cap fund could be substituted with a top-rated ELSS (Equity Linked Savings Scheme) fund. This would provide the same large-cap equity exposure while offering additional tax deductions. This change would not materially alter the portfolio's risk profile but would enhance its tax efficiency.\n- **Debt Taxation:** Gains from the debt funds will be added to the investor's income and taxed at their applicable income tax slab rate upon redemption.\n\n### **6. Conclusion & Final Recommendations**\nThis investment strategy provides a robust and disciplined framework for achieving the stated retirement goal. Its strength lies in its dynamic, time-aware structure that balances aggressive growth with prudent risk management. Success is contingent on consistent monthly investments and unwavering adherence to the annual rebalancing discipline and the pre-planned de-risking glide path in the final three years. This approach maximizes the probability of reaching the target corpus while minimizing the risk of significant capital erosion as retirement approaches.",

            "detailed": "### **1. Executive Summary**\nThis document outlines a detailed, goal-oriented investment strategy designed to build a retirement corpus of approximately â‚¹1.7 Crore over a 10-year period through a monthly SIP of â‚¹83,388. The strategy is tailored for an investor with a 'Moderate' risk profile. The core of the plan is a dynamic, three-phased asset allocation model that prioritizes growth in the early years and systematically shifts focus to capital preservation as the retirement date approaches. The portfolio is constructed using four highly-rated mutual funds: Parag Parikh Flexi Cap, Quant Mid Cap, HDFC Corporate Bond, and ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund, starting with a balanced 50% allocation to equity and 50% to debt.\n\n### **2. Investment Profile & Goal Alignment**\n- **Goal:** Retirement Planning\n- **Time Horizon:** 10 Years\n- **Risk Profile:** Moderate\n- **Monthly SIP:** â‚¹83,388\n- **Target Corpus (Inflation-Adjusted):** â‚¹1,70,81,445\n\nThe strategy directly aligns with these parameters by creating a portfolio that balances growth potential with risk management. The 10-year horizon is sufficient to absorb equity market volatility, while the moderate risk profile is reflected in the foundational 50/50 asset split.\n\n### **3. The 3-Phase Portfolio Progression: A Dynamic Glide Path Strategy**\nThe cornerstone of this strategy is its time-segmented approach, ensuring the portfolio's risk profile evolves appropriately as the goal nears.\n\n**Phase 1: Accumulation & Growth (Years 1-3)**\n- **Objective:** To maximize capital appreciation by leveraging the full time horizon.\n- **Rationale:** During this phase, the focus is on accumulating units and allowing the power of compounding to work, especially in the growth-oriented portion of the portfolio.\n- **Allocation Strategy:**\n  - **Total Equity: 50%**\n    - Parag Parikh Flexi Cap (Large Cap): 25% (â‚¹20,847/month)\n    - Quant Mid Cap Fund (Mid Cap): 25% (â‚¹20,847/month)\n  - **Total Debt: 50%**\n    - HDFC Corporate Bond Fund: 25% (â‚¹20,847/month)\n    - ICICI Prudential Short Term Fund: 25% (â‚¹20,847/month)\n\n**Phase 2: Consolidation & Rebalancing (Years 4-7)**\n- **Objective:** To maintain the strategic asset allocation and lock in gains.\n- **Rationale:** As the corpus grows, preventing significant deviation from the target risk profile becomes critical. This phase emphasizes discipline.\n- **Allocation Strategy:** The target allocation remains 50% Equity and 50% Debt. An annual review is conducted. If market movements cause the split to deviate (e.g., equity grows to 57% and debt shrinks to 43%), action is taken to bring it back to the 50/50 target. This disciplined selling of outperforming assets and buying of underperforming ones is a proven risk management technique.\n\n**Phase 3: Capital Preservation & De-risking (Years 8-10)**\n- **Objective:** To systematically reduce portfolio risk and protect the accumulated capital from market volatility.\n- **Rationale:** A significant market downturn just before retirement can be devastating. This phase involves a pre-defined, gradual shift from the most volatile asset class (Mid Cap Equity) to a more stable one (Corporate Bond Debt).\n- **Glide Path Allocation Targets:**\n  - **At the start of Year 8:** Shift allocation to **Equity 45% / Debt 55%**. (Reduce Quant Mid Cap to 20%, Increase HDFC Corporate Bond to 30%).\n  - **At the start of Year 9:** Shift allocation to **Equity 40% / Debt 60%**. (Reduce Quant Mid Cap to 15%, Increase HDFC Corporate Bond to 35%).\n  - **At the start of Year 10:** Final target allocation of **Equity 35% / Debt 65%**. (Reduce Parag Parikh Flexi to 20%, hold Quant Mid Cap at 15%, Increase HDFC Corporate Bond to 40%).\nThis structured de-risking ensures a smoother journey towards the target corpus in the final, most critical years.\n\n### **4. Implementation Roadmap & Monitoring Framework**\n1.  **Initial Setup (Month 1):** Open accounts with the respective AMCs or through a centralized platform. Set up four monthly SIPs for â‚¹20,847 each in the recommended funds.\n2.  **Ongoing Investment (Months 2-84):** Continue the monthly SIPs as per the Phase 1 & 2 allocation. Do not react to short-term market noise. Focus on the long-term goal.\n3.  **Annual Review:** At the end of each investment year, review the portfolio's overall asset allocation. Rebalance if the equity/debt split has deviated by more than 5% from the target.\n4.  **Execute De-risking (Years 8, 9, 10):** At the beginning of years 8, 9, and 10, execute the planned rebalancing to meet the glide path targets. This may involve redirecting SIPs and/or selling some equity units to buy debt units.\n\n### **5. Tax Optimization Strategy**\n- **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** All equity fund units should ideally be held for more than one year. When rebalancing requires selling, prioritize selling units that have been held for over 12 months to qualify for the lower LTCG tax rate. Gains up to â‚¹1 lakh per financial year are tax-free.\n- **ELSS Consideration:** The investor should assess their Section 80C tax-saving needs. If there is available capacity, a portion of the investment in the Parag Parikh Flexi Cap fund could be substituted with a top-rated ELSS (Equity Linked Savings Scheme) fund. This would provide the same large-cap equity exposure while offering additional tax deductions. This change would not materially alter the portfolio's risk profile but would enhance its tax efficiency.\n- **Debt Taxation:** Gains from the debt funds will be added to the investor's income and taxed at their applicable income tax slab rate upon redemption.\n\n### **6. Conclusion & Final Recommendations**\nThis investment strategy provides a robust and disciplined framework for achieving the stated retirement goal. Its strength lies in its dynamic, time-aware structure that balances aggressive growth with prudent risk management. Success is contingent on consistent monthly investments and unwavering adherence to the annual rebalancing discipline and the pre-planned de-risking glide path in the final three years. This approach maximizes the probability of reaching the target corpus while minimizing the risk of significant capital erosion as retirement approaches.",
