Adjust the target amount for inflation. 3. Calculate the required monthly SIP. 4. Define the asset allocation based on the risk profile. 5. Generate a full month-by-month projection table for the entire investment horizon. I will perform these calculations sequentially and then assemble them into the final structured JSON output. The time horizon is 2030 - 2025 = 5 years (60 months). Risk appetite is 'moderate', which maps to a 10% annual return and a 50/50 equity/debt allocation. Inflation is the default 5.5%. I will calculate the inflation-adjusted target first, then use it to find the SIP amount, and finally use that SIP amount to build the 60-month projection table.",

While the equity funds align well with the plan's category recommendations, a significant mismatch exists for the debt portion, as the only shortlisted debt fund is from a category not originally recommended. The final plan details a specific fund allocation but includes critical warnings regarding the debt component's risk profile.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The primary objective of this task is to bridge the strategic asset allocation defined in step T001 with the tactical fund shortlist generated in step T012. This involves mapping specific mutual funds to the recommended asset classes and categories, creating an actionable investment plan for a monthly SIP of INR 168,767.13.\n\n### Analysis of the Allocation Plan (from T001)\nThe strategic foundation is a 'moderate' risk profile, translating to a balanced portfolio with a 50% allocation to equity and a 50% allocation to debt. This split aims to capture growth through equities while providing stability and lower volatility through debt instruments. The plan further refines this by recommending specific sub-categories:\n- **Equity (50%):** Investment to be directed towards 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Mid Cap Funds'. This combination seeks to balance the stability of large, established companies with the higher growth potential of mid-sized companies.\n- **Debt (50%):** Investment to be directed towards 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'. This suggests a preference for relatively safe debt instruments, focusing on high-quality corporate debt and minimizing interest rate risk with shorter-maturity bonds.\n\n### Analysis of the Fund Shortlist (from T012)\nThe shortlist, derived from noisy web-scraped data, provides a limited but useful set of candidate funds:\n- **Equity Funds:** Three funds were identified: 'Motilal Oswal Large and Midcap Fund', 'Invesco India Large & Mid Cap Fund', and 'Bandhan Large & Mid Cap Fund'. All three fall under the 'Large & Mid Cap' category, which is an excellent match for the recommended equity strategy.\n- **Debt Fund:** Only one fund was successfully extracted: 'Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund'. Its category is 'Debt - Credit Risk'.\n\n### Reconciliation and Plan Formulation\nReconciling these two inputs reveals a smooth path for the equity component but a significant challenge for the debt component.\n\n**Equity Allocation (50% of SIP):**\nGiven the three suitable 'Large & Mid Cap' funds, the 50% equity portion of the SIP (approximately INR 84,384) can be diversified among them. To provide a concrete plan, we propose the following split, giving a slightly higher weight to the fund for which T012 provided the most complete performance data:\n1.  **Motilal Oswal Large and Midcap Fund (20% of total SIP):** A leading allocation due to its strong reported 5-year returns and large AUM, suggesting market confidence and performance.\n2.  **Invesco India Large & Mid Cap Fund (15% of total SIP):** A solid supporting fund with strong reported returns.\n3.  **Bandhan Large & Mid Cap Fund (15% of total SIP):** Included for diversification, though T012 noted less complete data was available for it.\nThis allocation fully satisfies the equity portion of the strategic plan.\n\n**Debt Allocation (50% of SIP):**\nThis is the most critical part of the reconciliation. The strategic plan calls for lower-risk debt categories ('Corporate Bond', 'Short Duration'), but the tactical shortlist provides only a 'Credit Risk' fund. These categories are fundamentally different:\n- **Corporate Bond / Short Duration Funds:** Primarily invest in debt issued by high-rated companies (e.g., AAA, AA). The main risk is interest rate fluctuation, which is mitigated in short-duration funds. The risk of default is low.\n- **Credit Risk Funds:** As per SEBI regulations, these funds must invest at least 65% of their assets in corporate bonds rated AA or lower. They intentionally take on higher credit risk (risk of the issuer defaulting) in pursuit of higher yields. This makes them significantly riskier than a typical corporate bond fund.\n\nAllocating the entire 50% debt portion to a 'Credit Risk' fund would materially increase the overall risk profile of the portfolio, deviating from the original 'moderate' risk appetite. The quality assessment in T012 explicitly noted that data for other debt categories was sparse, which explains this mismatch. \n\nTherefore, while we will include this fund in the final plan to fulfill the request, it comes with a major caveat. The user must either consciously accept this higher-risk debt strategy or seek out funds that align with the originally recommended categories.",

To reach this target, a monthly investment of INR 168,767 is required, based on a projected annual return of 10%. The strategy employs a balanced asset allocation of 50% in equity and 50% in debt, consistent with a 'moderate' risk profile. While the plan identifies suitable fund categories for the equity portion (Large & Mid Cap Funds), a critical finding requires your immediate attention: there is a significant mismatch between the recommended low-risk debt fund categories ('Corporate Bond', 'Short Duration') and the higher-risk category ('Credit Risk') of the available shortlisted funds. This report provides clear recommendations to address this discrepancy to ensure your portfolio remains aligned with your stated risk tolerance.",

By recommending a mix of 'Large Cap' and 'Mid Cap' funds, the strategy aims to combine the relative stability and consistent performance of India's largest companies with the higher growth potential of emerging mid-sized corporations. This diversification within equities helps to capture broad market growth over the 5-year investment horizon.\n\n**Debt (50%):** This portion is designed to provide stability, preserve capital, and generate predictable returns, acting as a buffer against equity market volatility. The ideal instruments for this role, given your moderate risk profile and 5-year timeline, are 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'. These categories primarily invest in high-quality debt from reputable companies, minimizing the risk of default. It is crucial to note that implementing this part of the strategy requires careful fund selection, as simply choosing any debt fund can inadvertently increase your portfolio's risk profile beyond the intended 'moderate' level.",

                  "Risk Factors and Uncertainties": "All investments are subject to risk, and it is essential to understand the factors that could impact your financial goal. This plan is based on assumptions that may differ from future reality. \n\n**Market Risk:** The projected 10% annual return is an estimate, not a guarantee. Equity and debt markets are inherently volatile and can be influenced by economic conditions, interest rate changes, regulatory policies, and geopolitical events. A market downturn could lead to the final corpus being lower than projected. Over a 5-year period, this risk is moderate but significant.\n\n**Credit Risk in Debt Allocation (Specific & High-Impact):** This is the most critical and immediate risk identified in your plan. The strategic plan recommends low-risk debt categories ('Corporate Bond', 'Short Duration'). However, analysis of available funds highlighted an option from the 'Credit Risk' category. These funds intentionally invest in lower-rated corporate bonds to seek higher returns. This introduces a significantly higher risk of default, where the bond issuer fails to repay its debt, which could lead to a permanent loss of your invested capital. Allocating 50% of your portfolio to this category would fundamentally alter your plan's risk profile from 'moderate' to 'aggressive', which is a serious deviation that requires your explicit consent or correction.\n\n**Inflation Risk:** The plan assumes an average annual inflation rate of 5.5%. If the actual rate of inflation is higher over the next five years, the purchasing power of your final target corpus of INR 1.31 Crore will be eroded. This could mean that the accumulated amount is insufficient to cover the actual cost of your house purchase in the future.\n\n**Data Reliability:** The fund shortlisting process was based on web-scraped data, which carries a risk of being incomplete or outdated. It is imperative to verify all information with official, reliable sources before committing any funds."

Executive Summary -->\n    <section id=\"executive-summary\" class=\"summary-card\">\n      <h2>🎯 Executive Summary</h2>\n      <p>This Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is designed to help you achieve your goal of a 'House Purchase' by accumulating a target corpus of approximately INR 1.31 Crore over the next 5 years, accounting for a 5.5% annual inflation rate on your initial goal of INR 1 Crore. To reach this target, a monthly investment of INR 168,767 is required, based on a projected annual return of 10%. The strategy employs a balanced asset allocation of 50% in equity and 50% in debt, consistent with a 'moderate' risk profile. While the plan identifies suitable fund categories for the equity portion (Large & Mid Cap Funds), a critical finding requires your immediate attention: there is a significant mismatch between the recommended low-risk debt fund categories ('Corporate Bond', 'Short Duration') and the higher-risk category ('Credit Risk') of the available shortlisted funds. This report provides clear recommendations to address this discrepancy to ensure your portfolio remains aligned with your stated risk tolerance.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- 3.

Key Recommendations -->\n    <section id=\"key-recommendations\">\n      <h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2>\n      <div class=\"recommendation\"><strong>(High Priority) Implement the Equity Plan:</strong> Begin investing 50% of your monthly SIP (approximately INR 84,384) into a diversified mix of 'Large & Mid Cap' equity mutual funds to target long-term growth.</div>\n      <div class=\"recommendation\"><strong>(Critical Priority) Take Corrective Action on Debt Allocation:</strong> Do not proceed with a debt fund from the 'Credit Risk' category without full consideration. You must actively search for and select funds within the originally recommended 'Corporate Bond' or 'Short Duration' categories to keep your portfolio aligned with a 'moderate' risk profile.</div>\n      <div class=\"recommendation\"><strong>(High Priority) Maintain Investment Discipline:</strong> Consistency is key to the success of any SIP. Ensure you invest the recommended amount regularly every month for the full 5-year term to leverage the benefits of compounding and rupee cost averaging.</div>\n      <div class=\"recommendation\"><strong>(Medium Priority) Verify All Fund Information:</strong> Before making any investment, independently verify all fund details such as historical performance, expense ratios, and fund manager history using official sources.</div>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- 8. Risk Factors & Uncertainties -->\n    <section id=\"risk-factors\">\n        <h2>⚠️ Risk Factors & Uncertainties</h2>\n        <p>All investments are subject to risk, and it is essential to understand the factors that could impact your financial goal. This plan is based on assumptions that may differ from future reality.</p>\n        <div class=\"summary-card risk-warning\">\n            <h3>Credit Risk in Debt Allocation (Specific & High-Impact)</h3>\n            <p>This is the most critical and immediate risk identified in your plan. The strategic plan recommends low-risk debt categories ('Corporate Bond', 'Short Duration'). However, analysis of available funds highlighted an option from the 'Credit Risk' category. These funds intentionally invest in lower-rated corporate bonds to seek higher returns. This introduces a significantly higher risk of default, where the bond issuer fails to repay its debt, which could lead to a permanent loss of your invested capital. Allocating 50% of your portfolio to this category would fundamentally alter your plan's risk profile from 'moderate' to 'aggressive', which is a serious deviation that requires your explicit consent or correction.</p>\n        </div>\n        <h3>General Risks</h3>\n        <p><strong>Market Risk:</strong> The projected 10% annual return is an estimate, not a guarantee. Equity and debt markets are inherently volatile and can be influenced by economic conditions, interest rate changes, regulatory policies, and geopolitical events. A market downturn could lead to the final corpus being lower than projected. Over a 5-year period, this risk is moderate but significant.</p>\n        <p><strong>Inflation Risk:</strong> The plan assumes an average annual inflation rate of 5.5%. If the actual rate of inflation is higher over the next five years, the purchasing power of your final target corpus of INR 1.31 Crore will be eroded. This could mean that the accumulated amount is insufficient to cover the actual cost of your house purchase in the future.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- 9.

Adjust the target amount for inflation. 3. Calculate the required monthly SIP. 4. Define the asset allocation based on the risk profile. 5. Generate a full month-by-month projection table for the entire investment horizon. I will perform these calculations sequentially and then assemble them into the final structured JSON output. The time horizon is 2030 - 2025 = 5 years (60 months). Risk appetite is 'moderate', which maps to a 10% annual return and a 50/50 equity/debt allocation. Inflation is the default 5.5%. I will calculate the inflation-adjusted target first, then use it to find the SIP amount, and finally use that SIP amount to build the 60-month projection table.",

While the equity funds align well with the plan's category recommendations, a significant mismatch exists for the debt portion, as the only shortlisted debt fund is from a category not originally recommended. The final plan details a specific fund allocation but includes critical warnings regarding the debt component's risk profile.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The primary objective of this task is to bridge the strategic asset allocation defined in step T001 with the tactical fund shortlist generated in step T012. This involves mapping specific mutual funds to the recommended asset classes and categories, creating an actionable investment plan for a monthly SIP of INR 168,767.13.\n\n### Analysis of the Allocation Plan (from T001)\nThe strategic foundation is a 'moderate' risk profile, translating to a balanced portfolio with a 50% allocation to equity and a 50% allocation to debt. This split aims to capture growth through equities while providing stability and lower volatility through debt instruments. The plan further refines this by recommending specific sub-categories:\n- **Equity (50%):** Investment to be directed towards 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Mid Cap Funds'. This combination seeks to balance the stability of large, established companies with the higher growth potential of mid-sized companies.\n- **Debt (50%):** Investment to be directed towards 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'. This suggests a preference for relatively safe debt instruments, focusing on high-quality corporate debt and minimizing interest rate risk with shorter-maturity bonds.\n\n### Analysis of the Fund Shortlist (from T012)\nThe shortlist, derived from noisy web-scraped data, provides a limited but useful set of candidate funds:\n- **Equity Funds:** Three funds were identified: 'Motilal Oswal Large and Midcap Fund', 'Invesco India Large & Mid Cap Fund', and 'Bandhan Large & Mid Cap Fund'. All three fall under the 'Large & Mid Cap' category, which is an excellent match for the recommended equity strategy.\n- **Debt Fund:** Only one fund was successfully extracted: 'Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund'. Its category is 'Debt - Credit Risk'.\n\n### Reconciliation and Plan Formulation\nReconciling these two inputs reveals a smooth path for the equity component but a significant challenge for the debt component.\n\n**Equity Allocation (50% of SIP):**\nGiven the three suitable 'Large & Mid Cap' funds, the 50% equity portion of the SIP (approximately INR 84,384) can be diversified among them. To provide a concrete plan, we propose the following split, giving a slightly higher weight to the fund for which T012 provided the most complete performance data:\n1.  **Motilal Oswal Large and Midcap Fund (20% of total SIP):** A leading allocation due to its strong reported 5-year returns and large AUM, suggesting market confidence and performance.\n2.  **Invesco India Large & Mid Cap Fund (15% of total SIP):** A solid supporting fund with strong reported returns.\n3.  **Bandhan Large & Mid Cap Fund (15% of total SIP):** Included for diversification, though T012 noted less complete data was available for it.\nThis allocation fully satisfies the equity portion of the strategic plan.\n\n**Debt Allocation (50% of SIP):**\nThis is the most critical part of the reconciliation. The strategic plan calls for lower-risk debt categories ('Corporate Bond', 'Short Duration'), but the tactical shortlist provides only a 'Credit Risk' fund. These categories are fundamentally different:\n- **Corporate Bond / Short Duration Funds:** Primarily invest in debt issued by high-rated companies (e.g., AAA, AA). The main risk is interest rate fluctuation, which is mitigated in short-duration funds. The risk of default is low.\n- **Credit Risk Funds:** As per SEBI regulations, these funds must invest at least 65% of their assets in corporate bonds rated AA or lower. They intentionally take on higher credit risk (risk of the issuer defaulting) in pursuit of higher yields. This makes them significantly riskier than a typical corporate bond fund.\n\nAllocating the entire 50% debt portion to a 'Credit Risk' fund would materially increase the overall risk profile of the portfolio, deviating from the original 'moderate' risk appetite. The quality assessment in T012 explicitly noted that data for other debt categories was sparse, which explains this mismatch. \n\nTherefore, while we will include this fund in the final plan to fulfill the request, it comes with a major caveat. The user must either consciously accept this higher-risk debt strategy or seek out funds that align with the originally recommended categories.",

To reach this target, a monthly investment of INR 168,767 is required, based on a projected annual return of 10%. The strategy employs a balanced asset allocation of 50% in equity and 50% in debt, consistent with a 'moderate' risk profile. While the plan identifies suitable fund categories for the equity portion (Large & Mid Cap Funds), a critical finding requires your immediate attention: there is a significant mismatch between the recommended low-risk debt fund categories ('Corporate Bond', 'Short Duration') and the higher-risk category ('Credit Risk') of the available shortlisted funds. This report provides clear recommendations to address this discrepancy to ensure your portfolio remains aligned with your stated risk tolerance.",
                  "Allocation Notes": "The asset allocation strategy is the cornerstone of this investment plan, designed to balance risk and reward effectively. A 50/50 split between equity and debt was chosen to align with your 'moderate' risk appetite. \n\n**Equity (50%):** This portion of your investment is geared for growth. By recommending a mix of 'Large Cap' and 'Mid Cap' funds, the strategy aims to combine the relative stability and consistent performance of India's largest companies with the higher growth potential of emerging mid-sized corporations. This diversification within equities helps to capture broad market growth over the 5-year investment horizon.\n\n**Debt (50%):** This portion is designed to provide stability, preserve capital, and generate predictable returns, acting as a buffer against equity market volatility. The ideal instruments for this role, given your moderate risk profile and 5-year timeline, are 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'. These categories primarily invest in high-quality debt from reputable companies, minimizing the risk of default. It is crucial to note that implementing this part of the strategy requires careful fund selection, as simply choosing any debt fund can inadvertently increase your portfolio's risk profile beyond the intended 'moderate' level.",

                  "Risk Factors and Uncertainties": "All investments are subject to risk, and it is essential to understand the factors that could impact your financial goal. This plan is based on assumptions that may differ from future reality. \n\n**Market Risk:** The projected 10% annual return is an estimate, not a guarantee. Equity and debt markets are inherently volatile and can be influenced by economic conditions, interest rate changes, regulatory policies, and geopolitical events. A market downturn could lead to the final corpus being lower than projected. Over a 5-year period, this risk is moderate but significant.\n\n**Credit Risk in Debt Allocation (Specific & High-Impact):** This is the most critical and immediate risk identified in your plan. The strategic plan recommends low-risk debt categories ('Corporate Bond', 'Short Duration'). However, analysis of available funds highlighted an option from the 'Credit Risk' category. These funds intentionally invest in lower-rated corporate bonds to seek higher returns. This introduces a significantly higher risk of default, where the bond issuer fails to repay its debt, which could lead to a permanent loss of your invested capital. Allocating 50% of your portfolio to this category would fundamentally alter your plan's risk profile from 'moderate' to 'aggressive', which is a serious deviation that requires your explicit consent or correction.\n\n**Inflation Risk:** The plan assumes an average annual inflation rate of 5.5%. If the actual rate of inflation is higher over the next five years, the purchasing power of your final target corpus of INR 1.31 Crore will be eroded. This could mean that the accumulated amount is insufficient to cover the actual cost of your house purchase in the future.\n\n**Data Reliability:** The fund shortlisting process was based on web-scraped data, which carries a risk of being incomplete or outdated. It is imperative to verify all information with official, reliable sources before committing any funds."

The required sections are: Executive Summary, Goal Inputs, Inflation Adjustment, SIP Calculation, Asset Allocation Plan, Allocation Notes, Key Recommendations, Risk Factors and Uncertainties, SIP Charts, SIP Projection (long-horizon summary), and Month sip projection table.\n3.  Check if the 'Risk Factors & Uncertainties' section meets the minimum word count of 150 words.\n4.  Confirm that the embedded JSON for charts (`chart-data`) is present and not empty.\n5.  Confirm that the embedded JSON for the monthly table (`table-data`) is present and contains data for the first 12 months.\n6.  Based on these checks, I will formulate a verdict, list any issues found, and provide an overall quality score.",
