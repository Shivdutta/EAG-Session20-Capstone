The user's goal is retirement in 10 years with a moderate risk appetite. The recommended 50/50 split between equity and debt is a classic balanced approach designed to meet these specific parameters. The equity portion is engineered for growth, essential for building a substantial retirement corpus that can outpace inflation. It is split between Large Cap funds, which provide a stable foundation by investing in established, blue-chip companies, and Mid Cap funds, which are included as a growth catalyst. The 10-year horizon is adequate to ride out the higher volatility associated with mid-caps in pursuit of their potential for superior returns. The debt portion of the portfolio serves as the stabilizing anchor. Its primary role is capital preservation and reducing overall portfolio volatility, which is crucial as the retirement goal approaches. This allocation is divided between Corporate Bond funds, which offer steady income and are relatively safe by focusing on highly-rated companies, and Short Duration funds. The latter provide an additional layer of safety and liquidity due to their low sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. In essence, the portfolio is constructed with a dual objective: aggressive enough to grow the capital to the required level for retirement, yet conservative enough to protect the accumulated wealth, perfectly aligning with a 'moderate' risk profile over a 10-year period.",

To meet this goal with a 'moderate' risk appetite (assuming a 10% annual return), a monthly SIP contribution of <b>₹2,50,161</b> is required. The recommended asset allocation is a balanced <b>50% in Equity</b> for growth and <b>50% in Debt</b> for stability.

A balanced 50% equity and 50% debt allocation is recommended. This mix aims to achieve substantial capital growth through equities to build the required retirement corpus, while the debt component provides stability and capital protection to cushion against market volatility.</blockquote><h3>Equity Rationale (50%)</h3><p><b>Objective:</b> To generate inflation-beating returns and drive long-term capital appreciation, which is essential for accumulating a significant retirement fund over a 10-year period.</p><ul><li><b>Large Cap Funds:</b> These funds form the stable core of the equity portfolio. By investing in India's largest and most established companies, they aim for consistent, long-term growth with lower volatility compared to other equity types.</li><li><b>Mid Cap Funds:</b> These funds act as a growth catalyst. They invest in emerging, high-growth companies with the potential to deliver market-beating returns. The 10-year horizon is sufficient to absorb the higher volatility associated with mid-caps.</li></ul><h3>Debt Rationale (50%)</h3><p><b>Objective:</b> To provide portfolio stability, preserve capital, and generate regular, predictable income. This component acts as a counterbalance to the volatility of equities.</p><ul><li><b>Corporate Bond Funds:</b> These funds form the core of the debt allocation, investing in high-quality bonds issued by corporations. They offer a balance of safety and returns that are typically higher than traditional fixed deposits.</li><li><b>Short Duration Funds:</b> These funds add an extra layer of safety and liquidity. By investing in debt instruments with short maturities (1-3 years), they are less sensitive to interest rate changes, thus minimizing risk.</li></ul></section><section id='key-recommendations'><h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2><ol><li><b>Commence Immediately:</b> Start the monthly SIP of <b>₹2,50,161.08</b> at the earliest to maximize the benefit of compounding over the 120-month period.</li><li><b>Maintain Discipline:</b> Adhere strictly to the monthly investment schedule. Avoid pausing or stopping the SIP, as consistency is critical to achieving the long-term goal.</li><li><b>Adhere to Allocation:</b> Implement the 50/50 Equity-Debt allocation strategy by choosing funds within the recommended categories.</li><li><b>Annual Portfolio Review:</b> Conduct a portfolio review once a year to rebalance if necessary. This ensures the asset allocation remains aligned with the 50/50 strategic split.</li><li><b>Avoid Emotional Decisions:</b> Do not react to short-term market volatility. The 10-year horizon is designed to weather market cycles, and emotional selling or buying can be detrimental.</li></ol></section><section id='risk-factors'><h2>⚠️ Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2><p>This financial plan is based on assumptions and projections that are not guaranteed. It is essential to understand the inherent risks before proceeding. The final outcome may vary significantly based on several factors.</p><ul><li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 10% annual return is an assumption. Actual returns from equity markets can be volatile and may be lower (or higher) than projected. A prolonged bear market could negatively impact the final corpus.</li><li><b>Inflation Risk:</b> The plan assumes a 5.5% average inflation rate. If actual inflation is consistently higher, the real value of the target corpus will be eroded, and a larger sum may be required for retirement.</li><li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Changes in market interest rates can affect the performance of debt funds. A rising interest rate environment can lead to a temporary decline in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of bond funds, especially those with longer maturities.</li><li><b>Execution Risk:</b> The success of this plan is contingent on the investor's discipline. Failing to invest the required amount consistently, or withdrawing funds prematurely, will result in a shortfall from the target amount.</li><li><b>Fund Performance Risk:</b> The performance of individual mutual funds can vary. Poor fund selection or underperformance by a chosen fund manager can lead to returns that are below the benchmark and the plan's assumptions.</li></ul><p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <i>This report is for illustrative purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Factoring in a <b>5.5%</b> annual inflation rate, the inflation-adjusted target corpus required at age 60 is <b>₹5,12,44,328</b>. To meet this goal with a 'moderate' risk appetite (assuming a 10% annual return), a monthly SIP contribution of <b>₹2,50,161</b> is required. The recommended asset allocation is a balanced <b>50% in Equity</b> for growth and <b>50% in Debt</b> for stability. Following this plan, the projected final corpus after 10 years (120 months) is estimated to be <b>₹5,10,01,861</b>, closely aligning with the inflation-adjusted target.</p>\n      <ul class=\"executive-summary-list\">\n        <li><b>Goal:</b> Retirement</li>\n        <li><b>Time Horizon:</b> 10 Years (120 Months)</li>\n        <li><b>Inflation-Adjusted Target:</b> ₹5,12,44,328.18</li>\n        <li><b>Required Monthly SIP:</b> ₹2,50,161.08</li>\n        <li><b>Asset Allocation:</b> 50% Equity / 50% Debt</li>\n        <li><b>Projected Corpus:</b> ₹5,10,01,861.15</li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- Goal Inputs -->\n    <section id=\"goal-inputs\">\n      <h2>📋 Goal Inputs</h2>\n      <p>The financial plan is based on the following parameters provided by the client.</p>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Goal Type</td><td>Retirement</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Current Age</td><td>50</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Target Retirement Age</td><td>60</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Target Amount</td><td>₹3,00,00,000</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Time Horizon</td><td>10 Years</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Total Investment Period</td><td>120 Months</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Risk Appetite</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- Inflation Adjustment -->\n    <section id=\"inflation-adjustment\">\n      <h2>🌬️ Inflation Adjustment</h2>\n      <p>To preserve purchasing power, the target amount has been adjusted for inflation over the 10-year period.</p>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Assumed Annual Inflation</td><td>5.5%</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Unadjusted Target</td><td>₹3,00,00,000</td></tr>\n          <tr><td><b>Inflation-Adjusted Target</b></td><td><b>₹5,12,44,328.18</b></td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- SIP Calculation -->\n    <section id=\"sip-calculation\">\n      <h2>🧮 SIP Calculation</h2>\n      <p>Based on the adjusted target and assumed market returns, the required monthly SIP contribution is calculated as follows.</p>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Assumed Annual Return (Moderate Risk)</td><td>10%</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Calculated Monthly Return (r)</td><td>0.833%</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Investment Period (n)</td><td>120 Months</td></tr>\n          <tr><td><b>Required Monthly SIP</b></td><td><b>₹2,50,161.08</b></td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- Asset Allocation -->\n    <section id=\"asset-allocation\">\n      <h2>📊 Asset Allocation Plan</h2>\n      <p>A balanced allocation is recommended to align with the 'moderate' risk profile, aiming for both growth and capital preservation.</p>\n      <div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:space-around; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 6px;\">\n        <div><h3>Equity Allocation: 50%</h3><ul><li>Large Cap Funds</li><li>Mid Cap Funds</li></ul></div>\n        <div><h3>Debt Allocation: 50%</h3><ul><li>Corporate Bond Funds</li><li>Short Duration Funds</li></ul></div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- Key Recommendations -->\n    <section id=\"key-recommendations\">\n      <h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2>\n      <ol>\n        <li><b>Commence Immediately:</b> Start the monthly SIP of <b>₹2,50,161.08</b> at the earliest to maximize the benefit of compounding over the 120-month period.</li>\n        <li><b>Maintain Discipline:</b> Adhere strictly to the monthly investment schedule. Avoid pausing or stopping the SIP, as consistency is critical to achieving the long-term goal.</li>\n        <li><b>Adhere to Allocation:</b> Implement the 50/50 Equity-Debt allocation strategy by choosing funds within the recommended categories.</li>\n        <li><b>Annual Portfolio Review:</b> Conduct a portfolio review once a year to rebalance if necessary. This ensures the asset allocation remains aligned with the 50/50 strategic split.</li>\n        <li><b>Avoid Emotional Decisions:</b> Do not react to short-term market volatility.

It is essential to understand the inherent risks before proceeding. The final outcome may vary significantly based on several factors.</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 10% annual return is an assumption. Actual returns from equity markets can be volatile and may be lower (or higher) than projected. A prolonged bear market could negatively impact the final corpus, and past performance is not indicative of future results.</li>\n        <li><b>Inflation Risk:</b> The plan assumes a 5.5% average inflation rate. If actual inflation is consistently higher, the real value of the target corpus will be eroded, and a larger sum may be required for retirement, diminishing purchasing power.</li>\n        <li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Changes in market interest rates can affect the performance of debt funds. A rising interest rate environment can lead to a temporary decline in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of bond funds, especially those with longer maturities.</li>\n        <li><b>Execution Risk:</b> The success of this plan is contingent on the investor's discipline. Failing to invest the required amount consistently, or withdrawing funds prematurely, will result in a significant shortfall from the target amount.</li>\n        <li><b>Fund Performance Risk:</b> The performance of individual mutual funds can vary. Poor fund selection or underperformance by a chosen fund manager can lead to returns that are below the benchmark and the plan's assumptions, impacting the final corpus.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p><i>Disclaimer: This report is for illustrative purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

President Donald Trumps trade and fiscal policies have led to market uncertainty and are likely leading the Federal Reserve to hold off on cutting interest rates. An easing monetary policy does not appear to be in the cards in the near term, says Morningstar Chief US Market Strategist Dave Sekera . Yet, despite all that, bonds are having a decent year: The Morningstar US Core Bond Index is up 2.34% this year through June 10. Is a Short-Term Bond Fund a Good Investment? Morningstar Director of Personal Finance and Retirement Planning Christine Benz says whether or not to own a short-term bond fund should depend on your time horizon and when you need to tap into the money, not on whats happening in the bond market. If youre planning to spend these dollars in six to 10 years, intermediate-term core bond funds remain the place to be, she says. But if youre saving for a shorter-term goal in the next three to five years, short-term bond funds remain better options.

The user's goal is retirement in 10 years with a moderate risk appetite. The recommended 50/50 split between equity and debt is a classic balanced approach designed to meet these specific parameters. The equity portion is engineered for growth, essential for building a substantial retirement corpus that can outpace inflation. It is split between Large Cap funds, which provide a stable foundation by investing in established, blue-chip companies, and Mid Cap funds, which are included as a growth catalyst. The 10-year horizon is adequate to ride out the higher volatility associated with mid-caps in pursuit of their potential for superior returns. The debt portion of the portfolio serves as the stabilizing anchor. Its primary role is capital preservation and reducing overall portfolio volatility, which is crucial as the retirement goal approaches. This allocation is divided between Corporate Bond funds, which offer steady income and are relatively safe by focusing on highly-rated companies, and Short Duration funds. The latter provide an additional layer of safety and liquidity due to their low sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. In essence, the portfolio is constructed with a dual objective: aggressive enough to grow the capital to the required level for retirement, yet conservative enough to protect the accumulated wealth, perfectly aligning with a 'moderate' risk profile over a 10-year period.",

The most critical part is the integration of the SIP charts and the 12-month projection table. I will use the exact v8 HTML/JavaScript structure provided in the prompt for this. The chart data will be sourced directly from T015's `chart_data_json`, and the table rows will be generated from T016's `first_12_months_table_json`. I will ensure all currency values are properly formatted. The final output will be a single, minified HTML string.

Factoring in a <b>5.5%</b> annual inflation rate, the inflation-adjusted target corpus required at age 60 is <b>₹5,12,44,328</b>. To meet this goal with a 'moderate' risk appetite (assuming a 10% annual return), a monthly SIP contribution of <b>₹2,50,161</b> is required. The recommended asset allocation is a balanced <b>50% in Equity</b> for growth and <b>50% in Debt</b> for stability.

A balanced 50% equity and 50% debt allocation is recommended. This mix aims to achieve substantial capital growth through equities to build the required retirement corpus, while the debt component provides stability and capital protection to cushion against market volatility.</blockquote><h3>Equity Rationale (50%)</h3><p><b>Objective:</b> To generate inflation-beating returns and drive long-term capital appreciation, which is essential for accumulating a significant retirement fund over a 10-year period.</p><ul><li><b>Large Cap Funds:</b> These funds form the stable core of the equity portfolio. By investing in India's largest and most established companies, they aim for consistent, long-term growth with lower volatility compared to other equity types.</li><li><b>Mid Cap Funds:</b> These funds act as a growth catalyst. They invest in emerging, high-growth companies with the potential to deliver market-beating returns. The 10-year horizon is sufficient to absorb the higher volatility associated with mid-caps.</li></ul><h3>Debt Rationale (50%)</h3><p><b>Objective:</b> To provide portfolio stability, preserve capital, and generate regular, predictable income. This component acts as a counterbalance to the volatility of equities.</p><ul><li><b>Corporate Bond Funds:</b> These funds form the core of the debt allocation, investing in high-quality bonds issued by corporations. They offer a balance of safety and returns that are typically higher than traditional fixed deposits.</li><li><b>Short Duration Funds:</b> These funds add an extra layer of safety and liquidity. By investing in debt instruments with short maturities (1-3 years), they are less sensitive to interest rate changes, thus minimizing risk.</li></ul></section><section id='key-recommendations'><h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2><ol><li><b>Commence Immediately:</b> Start the monthly SIP of <b>₹2,50,161.08</b> at the earliest to maximize the benefit of compounding over the 120-month period.</li><li><b>Maintain Discipline:</b> Adhere strictly to the monthly investment schedule. Avoid pausing or stopping the SIP, as consistency is critical to achieving the long-term goal.</li><li><b>Adhere to Allocation:</b> Implement the 50/50 Equity-Debt allocation strategy by choosing funds within the recommended categories.</li><li><b>Annual Portfolio Review:</b> Conduct a portfolio review once a year to rebalance if necessary. This ensures the asset allocation remains aligned with the 50/50 strategic split.</li><li><b>Avoid Emotional Decisions:</b> Do not react to short-term market volatility. The 10-year horizon is designed to weather market cycles, and emotional selling or buying can be detrimental.</li></ol></section><section id='risk-factors'><h2>⚠️ Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2><p>This financial plan is based on assumptions and projections that are not guaranteed. It is essential to understand the inherent risks before proceeding. The final outcome may vary significantly based on several factors.</p><ul><li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 10% annual return is an assumption. Actual returns from equity markets can be volatile and may be lower (or higher) than projected. A prolonged bear market could negatively impact the final corpus.</li><li><b>Inflation Risk:</b> The plan assumes a 5.5% average inflation rate. If actual inflation is consistently higher, the real value of the target corpus will be eroded, and a larger sum may be required for retirement.</li><li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Changes in market interest rates can affect the performance of debt funds. A rising interest rate environment can lead to a temporary decline in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of bond funds, especially those with longer maturities.</li><li><b>Execution Risk:</b> The success of this plan is contingent on the investor's discipline. Failing to invest the required amount consistently, or withdrawing funds prematurely, will result in a shortfall from the target amount.</li><li><b>Fund Performance Risk:</b> The performance of individual mutual funds can vary. Poor fund selection or underperformance by a chosen fund manager can lead to returns that are below the benchmark and the plan's assumptions.</li></ul><p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <i>This report is for illustrative purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Factoring in a <b>5.5%</b> annual inflation rate, the inflation-adjusted target corpus required at age 60 is <b>₹5,12,44,328</b>. To meet this goal with a 'moderate' risk appetite (assuming a 10% annual return), a monthly SIP contribution of <b>₹2,50,161</b> is required. The recommended asset allocation is a balanced <b>50% in Equity</b> for growth and <b>50% in Debt</b> for stability. Following this plan, the projected final corpus after 10 years (120 months) is estimated to be <b>₹5,10,01,861</b>, closely aligning with the inflation-adjusted target.</p>\n      <ul class=\"executive-summary-list\">\n        <li><b>Goal:</b> Retirement</li>\n        <li><b>Time Horizon:</b> 10 Years (120 Months)</li>\n        <li><b>Inflation-Adjusted Target:</b> ₹5,12,44,328.18</li>\n        <li><b>Required Monthly SIP:</b> ₹2,50,161.08</li>\n        <li><b>Asset Allocation:</b> 50% Equity / 50% Debt</li>\n        <li><b>Projected Corpus:</b> ₹5,10,01,861.15</li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- Goal Inputs -->\n    <section id=\"goal-inputs\">\n      <h2>📋 Goal Inputs</h2>\n      <p>The financial plan is based on the following parameters provided by the client.</p>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Goal Type</td><td>Retirement</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Current Age</td><td>50</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Target Retirement Age</td><td>60</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Target Amount</td><td>₹3,00,00,000</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Time Horizon</td><td>10 Years</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Total Investment Period</td><td>120 Months</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Risk Appetite</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- Inflation Adjustment -->\n    <section id=\"inflation-adjustment\">\n      <h2>🌬️ Inflation Adjustment</h2>\n      <p>To preserve purchasing power, the target amount has been adjusted for inflation over the 10-year period.</p>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Assumed Annual Inflation</td><td>5.5%</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Unadjusted Target</td><td>₹3,00,00,000</td></tr>\n          <tr><td><b>Inflation-Adjusted Target</b></td><td><b>₹5,12,44,328.18</b></td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- SIP Calculation -->\n    <section id=\"sip-calculation\">\n      <h2>🧮 SIP Calculation</h2>\n      <p>Based on the adjusted target and assumed market returns, the required monthly SIP contribution is calculated as follows.</p>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Assumed Annual Return (Moderate Risk)</td><td>10%</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Calculated Monthly Return (r)</td><td>0.833%</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Investment Period (n)</td><td>120 Months</td></tr>\n          <tr><td><b>Required Monthly SIP</b></td><td><b>₹2,50,161.08</b></td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- Asset Allocation -->\n    <section id=\"asset-allocation\">\n      <h2>📊 Asset Allocation Plan</h2>\n      <p>A balanced allocation is recommended to align with the 'moderate' risk profile, aiming for both growth and capital preservation.</p>\n      <div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:space-around; text-align: center; margin: 20px 0; padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 6px;\">\n        <div><h3>Equity Allocation: 50%</h3><ul><li>Large Cap Funds</li><li>Mid Cap Funds</li></ul></div>\n        <div><h3>Debt Allocation: 50%</h3><ul><li>Corporate Bond Funds</li><li>Short Duration Funds</li></ul></div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- Key Recommendations -->\n    <section id=\"key-recommendations\">\n      <h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2>\n      <ol>\n        <li><b>Commence Immediately:</b> Start the monthly SIP of <b>₹2,50,161.08</b> at the earliest to maximize the benefit of compounding over the 120-month period.</li>\n        <li><b>Maintain Discipline:</b> Adhere strictly to the monthly investment schedule. Avoid pausing or stopping the SIP, as consistency is critical to achieving the long-term goal.</li>\n        <li><b>Adhere to Allocation:</b> Implement the 50/50 Equity-Debt allocation strategy by choosing funds within the recommended categories.</li>\n        <li><b>Annual Portfolio Review:</b> Conduct a portfolio review once a year to rebalance if necessary. This ensures the asset allocation remains aligned with the 50/50 strategic split.</li>\n        <li><b>Avoid Emotional Decisions:</b> Do not react to short-term market volatility.

It is essential to understand the inherent risks before proceeding. The final outcome may vary significantly based on several factors.</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><b>Market Risk:</b> The 10% annual return is an assumption. Actual returns from equity markets can be volatile and may be lower (or higher) than projected. A prolonged bear market could negatively impact the final corpus, and past performance is not indicative of future results.</li>\n        <li><b>Inflation Risk:</b> The plan assumes a 5.5% average inflation rate. If actual inflation is consistently higher, the real value of the target corpus will be eroded, and a larger sum may be required for retirement, diminishing purchasing power.</li>\n        <li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Changes in market interest rates can affect the performance of debt funds. A rising interest rate environment can lead to a temporary decline in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of bond funds, especially those with longer maturities.</li>\n        <li><b>Execution Risk:</b> The success of this plan is contingent on the investor's discipline. Failing to invest the required amount consistently, or withdrawing funds prematurely, will result in a significant shortfall from the target amount.</li>\n        <li><b>Fund Performance Risk:</b> The performance of individual mutual funds can vary. Poor fund selection or underperformance by a chosen fund manager can lead to returns that are below the benchmark and the plan's assumptions, impacting the final corpus.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p><i>Disclaimer: This report is for illustrative purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.
