Second, I will adjust the target corpus of 3 Cr for a 10-year horizon at a 5.5% inflation rate. Third, I'll calculate the required monthly SIP to reach this inflation-adjusted target, assuming a 10% annual return (for 'moderate' risk). Fourth, I will define the asset allocation for a 'moderate' profile (50% equity, 50% debt) and suggest fund categories. Finally, and most critically, I will generate the full 120-month projection table showing the month-on-month growth of the corpus based on the calculated SIP and monthly return rate, strictly following the provided algorithm.",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The primary objective of this task is to perform a crucial reconciliation between the strategic investment plan and the tactical investment options. Specifically, this involves verifying that the `fund_shortlist_json` (from T012), which contains a distilled list of potential mutual funds, provides adequate coverage for the fund categories recommended in the `allocation_plan_json` (from T001).\n\n**Analysis of the Allocation Plan (T001)**\n\nThe investment strategy for the user's retirement goal is built on a 'moderate' risk profile. This translates to a balanced asset allocation of 50% in equity and 50% in debt. The plan further specifies the sub-categories for investment to achieve this balance:\n- **Equity (50%):** The allocation is to be split between 'Large Cap Funds' for stability and growth, and 'Mid Cap Funds' for higher growth potential.\n- **Debt (50%):** The allocation is to be split between 'Corporate Bond Funds' for stable returns and 'Government Securities' for maximum safety.\n\n**Analysis of the Fund Shortlist (T012)**\n\nThe shortlist, derived from web scraping, contains 15 funds across four distinct categories. Despite the raw and unstructured nature of the source data, the distillation process successfully identified funds in all the necessary categories:\n- **Large Cap:** 5 funds were identified.\n- **Mid Cap:** 5 funds were identified.\n- **Corporate Bond:** 4 funds were identified.\n- **Government Securities:** 1 fund was identified.\n\n**Reconciliation and Verification**\n\nThe core of this task is to map the plan's requirements to the shortlist's contents. The reconciliation confirms a perfect alignment:\n1.  **Large Cap Funds Requirement:** The plan requires 'Large Cap Funds'. The shortlist provides 5 funds under the 'Large Cap' category. This is a match.\n2.  **Mid Cap Funds Requirement:** The plan requires 'Mid Cap Funds'. The shortlist provides 5 funds under the 'Mid Cap' category. This is a match.\n3.  **Corporate Bond Funds Requirement:** The plan requires 'Corporate Bond Funds'. The shortlist provides 4 funds under the 'Corporate Bond' category. This is a match.\n4.  **Government Securities Requirement:** The plan requires 'Government Securities'. The shortlist provides 1 fund under the 'Government Securities' category. This is a match.\n\n**Generated Output: `reconciled_fund_options_json`**\n\nTo formalize this successful verification, a structured JSON object, `reconciled_fund_options_json`, has been generated. This object serves as a logical confirmation that the overall investment plan is feasible with the available options. It is structured hierarchically, reflecting the allocation plan itself. It starts with the two main asset classes (equity and debt), states their target allocation percentages, and then drills down into each required category. For each category, it confirms its 'Available' status and lists the specific fund names found in the shortlist. This output acts as a critical hand-off to the next agent in the chain, which can now proceed with the detailed selection of funds from these validated pools.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reconciliation is successful. The fund shortlist provides viable options for every category mandated by the asset allocation plan. The next logical step, which involves detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of these shortlisted funds to construct a final portfolio, can proceed with confidence.",

Equity markets are volatile and can experience downturns, potentially leading to a shortfall if poor performance persists. <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> primarily affects the debt portion of the portfolio. A rise in interest rates can lead to a fall in the value of existing bonds and bond funds. Furthermore, <b>Inflation Risk</b> poses a threat if the actual rate of inflation exceeds the projected 5.5%, thereby eroding the real value of the final corpus and requiring a larger investment to maintain the desired purchasing power. There is also <b>Concentration Risk</b> noted in the fund reconciliation, where only a single fund option was identified for the 'Government Securities' category, limiting choice. Lastly, <b>Execution Risk</b> lies with the investor; failing to invest regularly or reacting emotionally to market swings can significantly jeopardize the achievement of the financial goal. A disciplined, long-term perspective is crucial for mitigating these behavioral risks.</p></section><section id='sip-charts'><h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2><div class='charts-grid'><div

The primary objective is to accumulate a target corpus of ₹3,00,00,000, which, after adjusting for a projected annual inflation rate of 5.5%, requires a future value of <b>₹5,12,44,333.71</b>. Based on a 'moderate' risk profile with an assumed annual return of 10%, the analysis concludes that a monthly SIP contribution of <b>₹2,50,161.43</b> is necessary. The investment strategy recommends a balanced asset allocation of <b>50% in Equity</b> and <b>50% in Debt</b>. This disciplined approach is projected to build a final corpus of approximately <b>₹5,02,92,080.38</b> over 120 months.</p>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section id=\"goal-inputs\">\n        <h2>📋 Goal Inputs</h2>\n        <table>\n            <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr><td>Goal Type</td><td>Retirement</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Target Amount</td><td>₹3,00,00,000</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Time Horizon</td><td>10 Years (120 Months)</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Risk Appetite</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"inflation-adjustment\">\n        <h2>📈 Inflation Adjustment & SIP Calculation</h2>\n        <table>\n            <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr><td>Assumed Annual Inflation</td><td>5.5%</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Inflation-Adjusted Target</td><td><b>₹5,12,44,333.71</b></td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Assumed Annual Return</td><td>10.0%</td></tr>\n                <tr><td><b>Required Monthly SIP</b></td><td><b>₹2,50,161.43</b></td></tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"asset-allocation\">\n        <h2>⚖️ Asset Allocation Plan</h2>\n        <p>A balanced asset allocation is proposed to align with the 'moderate' risk appetite, diversifying investments across equity and debt instruments.</p>\n        <table>\n            <thead><tr><th>Asset Class</th><th>Allocation</th><th>Recommended Fund Categories</th></tr></thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr><td><b>Equity</b></td><td><b>50%</b></td><td>Large Cap Funds, Mid Cap Funds</td></tr>\n                <tr><td><b>Debt</b></td><td><b>50%</b></td><td>Corporate Bond Funds, Government Securities</td></tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section id=\"key-recommendations\">\n        <h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2>\n        <ol>\n            <li><b>Maintain Investment Discipline:</b> Adherence to the monthly SIP of ₹2,50,161.43 is critical.

Equity markets are volatile and can experience downturns. <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> primarily affects the debt portion of the portfolio. A rise in interest rates can lead to a fall in the value of existing bonds. <b>Inflation Risk</b> poses a threat if the actual rate of inflation exceeds the projected 5.5%, thereby eroding the real value of the final corpus. Lastly, <b>Execution Risk</b> lies with the investor; failing to invest regularly or reacting emotionally to market swings can jeopardize the achievement of the financial goal.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n      <h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2>\n      <div style=\"display: block;\">\n        <div class=\"chart-container\" style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;

A quick scan confirms that all four required categories from the allocation plan are represented in the shortlist.",
            "overall_observations": "Let me think through this: The core task is to verify a perfect match between the investment plan's category requirements and the available fund options from the shortlist.

My plan to create a structured JSON object that explicitly links the allocation plan's categories to the funds found in the shortlist directly addresses this goal.",
            "what_was_missed": "Let me think through this: I have not missed any categories. The only minor point is the naming variance ('Funds' suffix). My plan correctly treats these as identical, which is a safe assumption in this context. I should also note that the Government Securities category has only one option, which might be a point of concern for diversification later, but it doesn't prevent a successful reconciliation now.",
            "risk_of_misleading": "Let me think through this: The risk is low. This step is a logical check, not a final fund recommendation. The output will clearly state that options are 'available' for the required categories, not that they are the 'best' options. The subsequent agent must perform the qualitative and quantitative analysis to select the final funds. I must highlight that the availability of a category does not equate to the quality of the funds within it.",
            "improvement_opportunities": "Let me think through this: I can improve clarity by structuring the `reconciled_fund_options_json` to mirror the hierarchy of the original allocation plan: starting with the asset class (equity/debt), showing its target percentage, and then listing the categories within it, along with the specific fund options found for each. This makes the logical link between the plan and the options explicit."

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The primary objective of this task is to perform a crucial reconciliation between the strategic investment plan and the tactical investment options. Specifically, this involves verifying that the `fund_shortlist_json` (from T012), which contains a distilled list of potential mutual funds, provides adequate coverage for the fund categories recommended in the `allocation_plan_json` (from T001).\n\n**Analysis of the Allocation Plan (T001)**\n\nThe investment strategy for the user's retirement goal is built on a 'moderate' risk profile. This translates to a balanced asset allocation of 50% in equity and 50% in debt. The plan further specifies the sub-categories for investment to achieve this balance:\n- **Equity (50%):** The allocation is to be split between 'Large Cap Funds' for stability and growth, and 'Mid Cap Funds' for higher growth potential.\n- **Debt (50%):** The allocation is to be split between 'Corporate Bond Funds' for stable returns and 'Government Securities' for maximum safety.\n\n**Analysis of the Fund Shortlist (T012)**\n\nThe shortlist, derived from web scraping, contains 15 funds across four distinct categories. Despite the raw and unstructured nature of the source data, the distillation process successfully identified funds in all the necessary categories:\n- **Large Cap:** 5 funds were identified.\n- **Mid Cap:** 5 funds were identified.\n- **Corporate Bond:** 4 funds were identified.\n- **Government Securities:** 1 fund was identified.\n\n**Reconciliation and Verification**\n\nThe core of this task is to map the plan's requirements to the shortlist's contents. The reconciliation confirms a perfect alignment:\n1.  **Large Cap Funds Requirement:** The plan requires 'Large Cap Funds'. The shortlist provides 5 funds under the 'Large Cap' category. This is a match.\n2.  **Mid Cap Funds Requirement:** The plan requires 'Mid Cap Funds'. The shortlist provides 5 funds under the 'Mid Cap' category. This is a match.\n3.  **Corporate Bond Funds Requirement:** The plan requires 'Corporate Bond Funds'. The shortlist provides 4 funds under the 'Corporate Bond' category. This is a match.\n4.  **Government Securities Requirement:** The plan requires 'Government Securities'. The shortlist provides 1 fund under the 'Government Securities' category. This is a match.\n\n**Generated Output: `reconciled_fund_options_json`**\n\nTo formalize this successful verification, a structured JSON object, `reconciled_fund_options_json`, has been generated. This object serves as a logical confirmation that the overall investment plan is feasible with the available options. It is structured hierarchically, reflecting the allocation plan itself. It starts with the two main asset classes (equity and debt), states their target allocation percentages, and then drills down into each required category. For each category, it confirms its 'Available' status and lists the specific fund names found in the shortlist. This output acts as a critical hand-off to the next agent in the chain, which can now proceed with the detailed selection of funds from these validated pools.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reconciliation is successful. The fund shortlist provides viable options for every category mandated by the asset allocation plan. The next logical step, which involves detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of these shortlisted funds to construct a final portfolio, can proceed with confidence.",

The primary objective is to accumulate a target corpus of ₹3,00,00,000, which, after adjusting for a projected annual inflation rate of 5.5%, requires a future value of <b>₹5,12,44,333.71</b>. Based on a 'moderate' risk profile with an assumed annual return of 10%, the analysis concludes that a monthly SIP contribution of <b>₹2,50,161.43</b> is necessary.

Equity markets are volatile and can experience downturns, potentially leading to a shortfall if poor performance persists. <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> primarily affects the debt portion of the portfolio. A rise in interest rates can lead to a fall in the value of existing bonds and bond funds. Furthermore, <b>Inflation Risk</b> poses a threat if the actual rate of inflation exceeds the projected 5.5%, thereby eroding the real value of the final corpus and requiring a larger investment to maintain the desired purchasing power. There is also <b>Concentration Risk</b> noted in the fund reconciliation, where only a single fund option was identified for the 'Government Securities' category, limiting choice. Lastly, <b>Execution Risk</b> lies with the investor; failing to invest regularly or reacting emotionally to market swings can significantly jeopardize the achievement of the financial goal. A disciplined, long-term perspective is crucial for mitigating these behavioral risks.</p></section><section id='sip-charts'><h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2><div class='charts-grid'><div

The primary objective is to accumulate a target corpus of ₹3,00,00,000, which, after adjusting for a projected annual inflation rate of 5.5%, requires a future value of <b>₹5,12,44,333.71</b>. Based on a 'moderate' risk profile with an assumed annual return of 10%, the analysis concludes that a monthly SIP contribution of <b>₹2,50,161.43</b> is necessary. The investment strategy recommends a balanced asset allocation of <b>50% in Equity</b> and <b>50% in Debt</b>. This disciplined approach is projected to build a final corpus of approximately <b>₹5,02,92,080.38</b> over 120 months.</p>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section id=\"goal-inputs\">\n        <h2>📋 Goal Inputs</h2>\n        <table>\n            <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr><td>Goal Type</td><td>Retirement</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Target Amount</td><td>₹3,00,00,000</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Time Horizon</td><td>10 Years (120 Months)</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Risk Appetite</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"inflation-adjustment\">\n        <h2>📈 Inflation Adjustment & SIP Calculation</h2>\n        <table>\n            <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr><td>Assumed Annual Inflation</td><td>5.5%</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Inflation-Adjusted Target</td><td><b>₹5,12,44,333.71</b></td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Assumed Annual Return</td><td>10.0%</td></tr>\n                <tr><td><b>Required Monthly SIP</b></td><td><b>₹2,50,161.43</b></td></tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"asset-allocation\">\n        <h2>⚖️ Asset Allocation Plan</h2>\n        <p>A balanced asset allocation is proposed to align with the 'moderate' risk appetite, diversifying investments across equity and debt instruments.</p>\n        <table>\n            <thead><tr><th>Asset Class</th><th>Allocation</th><th>Recommended Fund Categories</th></tr></thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr><td><b>Equity</b></td><td><b>50%</b></td><td>Large Cap Funds, Mid Cap Funds</td></tr>\n                <tr><td><b>Debt</b></td><td><b>50%</b></td><td>Corporate Bond Funds, Government Securities</td></tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section id=\"key-recommendations\">\n        <h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2>\n        <ol>\n            <li><b>Maintain Investment Discipline:</b> Adherence to the monthly SIP of ₹2,50,161.43 is critical.

Equity markets are volatile and can experience downturns. <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> primarily affects the debt portion of the portfolio. A rise in interest rates can lead to a fall in the value of existing bonds. <b>Inflation Risk</b> poses a threat if the actual rate of inflation exceeds the projected 5.5%, thereby eroding the real value of the final corpus. Lastly, <b>Execution Risk</b> lies with the investor; failing to invest regularly or reacting emotionally to market swings can jeopardize the achievement of the financial goal.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n      <h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2>\n      <div style=\"display: block;\">\n        <div class=\"chart-container\" style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;
