Focus on disciplined investing without reacting to market noise.\n- **Mid Phase**: Continued accumulation with annual rebalancing to maintain the target 40/60 split. Begin planning the de-risking glide path for the final phase.\n- **Final Phase**: Capital preservation. Systematically de-risk the portfolio by gradually shifting from equity to safer debt instruments to protect the corpus from market volatility ahead of retirement.\n- **Additional Considerations**: Planning for post-retirement income via Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) and managing capital gains tax upon withdrawal are critical considerations for the final phase.\n\n## 📋 DO (STEP-BY-STEP)\n\n1. **Input Normalization** → Emit `fund_input_profile_json`\n2. **Fund Data Retrieval** → Call RetrieverAgent for goal-specific fund datasets  \n3. **Performance Analysis** → Refer \"Performance & Risk Computation\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n4. **Risk-Weighted Scoring** → Refer \"Ranking Algorithm\" from FundRecommendationAgent  \n5. **Fund Selection** → Refer \"Goal-Optimized Selection\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n6. **Output Generation** → Emit structured fund recommendation JSONs\n\n**Fund Category Guidelines for low_moderate (Retirement):**\n```json\n{\n  \"category_guidelines\": {\n    \"equity_allocation\": {\n      \"primary\": [\"Large Cap Funds\"],\n      \"secondary\": [\"Mid Cap Funds\"]\n    },\n    \"debt_allocation\": {\n      \"primary\": [\"Corporate Bond Funds\"],\n      \"secondary\": [\"Short Duration Funds\"]\n    },\n    \"optional_considerations\": {\n      \"notes\": \"Given the 10-year horizon, aggressive small-cap or sectoral funds are excluded to align with the low-moderate risk profile.
