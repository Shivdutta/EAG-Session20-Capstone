        "initial_thoughts": "Let me think through this... I need to process the user's goal for a 'House Purchase'. First, I will normalize the inputs into the `goal_input_json` structure. The prompt specifies a time horizon of 3 years (36 months), even though the target year is 2028. I will adhere to the specified 3 years. Next, I'll calculate the inflation-adjusted target amount using a 5.5% annual rate over 3 years. With the future value, I'll calculate the required monthly SIP. The user has a 'moderate' risk appetite, which maps to a 10% annual return (or 0.10/12 monthly). Using the standard SIP formula, I'll compute the monthly investment. This risk profile also dictates a 50/50 equity/debt asset allocation, which I will detail in `allocation_plan_json`, including recommended fund categories and standard notes. Finally, the most critical step is to generate the full 36-month `sip_projection_table_json`. I will iterate month by month, applying the compound interest formula to the growing balance and adding the new SIP contribution, ensuring the final corpus aligns with the calculated inflation-adjusted target.",

However, this strategy carries notable market risk due to the short time horizon.",
            "detailed": "### Strategic Analysis of Asset Allocation for House Purchase Goal\n\nThis report provides a detailed justification for the asset allocation plan formulated for the user's goal of purchasing a house, valued at an inflation-adjusted target of approximately ₹2.35 Crores, within a 3-year (36-month) timeframe, and aligned with a 'moderate' risk appetite.\n\n#### 1. The Core Strategic Dilemma: Time Horizon vs. Growth Requirement\n\nThe central challenge of this financial plan lies in the inherent conflict between the short investment horizon and the need for substantial capital growth. A 3-year period is typically considered short-term in investment planning, a timeframe where capital preservation is paramount. Equity markets, the primary driver of high growth, can exhibit significant volatility over such periods. A market downturn in the second or third year could severely impact the final corpus.\n\nConversely, relying solely on low-risk debt instruments would likely yield returns insufficient to meet the ambitious target of ₹2.35 Crores with the calculated monthly SIP of ~₹5.62 Lakhs. The plan assumes a 10% annualized return, a target that is difficult to achieve without significant equity exposure. Therefore, the strategy must navigate this dilemma by carefully balancing growth aspirations with risk management.\n\n#### 2. Rationale for the 50% Equity / 50% Debt Allocation\n\nThe 50/50 split between equity and debt is a direct implementation of the 'moderate' risk profile. It is not an arbitrary choice but a structured attempt to resolve the aforementioned dilemma.\n\n*   **The Growth Engine (50% Equity):** This portion of the portfolio is designed to generate the higher returns necessary to reach the financial goal. By investing in the stock market, the portfolio is positioned to outpace inflation and compound capital more aggressively than debt instruments alone. This exposure is what makes the 10% projected annual return a plausible target. It directly caters to the user's willingness to accept moderate risk for the potential of higher rewards.\n\n*   **The Stability Anchor (50% Debt):** This component is the risk-mitigation core of the strategy. With a fixed, non-negotiable 3-year deadline, protecting the accumulated capital from market shocks is critically important. The debt allocation acts as a buffer, reducing the overall volatility of the portfolio. In a scenario where the equity market performs poorly, this segment is expected to remain stable or provide modest positive returns, thus preserving a significant portion of the capital and preventing catastrophic losses near the goal's completion date.\n\nThis balanced mix seeks to provide a smoother investment journey than a pure equity portfolio while still offering a higher growth potential than a pure debt portfolio, making it a suitable, albeit aggressive, strategy for the given constraints.\n\n#### 3. Justification of Recommended Fund Categories\n\nThe selection of specific fund categories within the equity and debt allocations is crucial for fine-tuning the risk-return profile.\n\n**Equity Allocation (50% of Portfolio):**\n*   **Large Cap Funds:** These funds invest in the largest, most established companies in the market. They typically offer more stability and lower volatility compared to smaller companies. Allocating a significant portion of the equity investment here provides a foundational layer of growth with managed risk.\n*   **Mid Cap Funds:** These funds invest in mid-sized companies that often have higher growth potential than large caps. Including them adds a performance catalyst to the portfolio, essential for targeting the 10% return. The blend of Large and Mid Cap funds creates a diversified equity base that balances stability with aggressive growth.\n\n*Note on Omission:* Small Cap funds, while offering the highest growth potential, are deliberately excluded. Their extreme volatility makes them unsuitable for a short 3-year investment horizon where a sharp correction could be irrecoverable.\n\n**Debt Allocation (50% of Portfolio):**\n*   **Short Duration Funds:** This is arguably the most critical fund choice for this plan. These funds invest in debt instruments with short maturities (typically 1-3 years). Their primary advantage is low sensitivity to interest rate changes (duration risk). For a 3-year goal, this minimizes the risk that the fund's value will drop if interest rates rise, making them an ideal vehicle for capital preservation over this specific timeframe.\n*   **Corporate Bond Funds:** These funds invest in debt issued by corporations and generally offer higher yields (returns) than government securities, albeit with slightly higher credit risk. Their inclusion provides a modest return enhancement to the debt portion, helping the overall portfolio inch closer to its target return while maintaining a relatively low-risk profile.\n\n#### 4. Acknowledgment of Data Limitations and Inherent Risks\n\nIt is important to note that the upstream process for retrieving detailed, real-time fund category performance data (Task T012) failed. Therefore, this strategic analysis is based on the well-established, general characteristics of these fund categories rather than specific, current market data.\n\nThe primary risk of this strategy remains the **market risk** associated with a 50% equity exposure over just three years. The projected outcome is based on a smooth, average return of 10%, but reality is often different. The user must be prepared for the possibility that the final corpus may be lower than the target if the equity markets experience a downturn during the investment period. A contingency plan, such as extending the investment horizon or being prepared to make a larger down payment from other sources, should be considered.",

This risk profile also dictates a 50/50 equity/debt asset allocation, which I will detail in `allocation_plan_json`, including recommended fund categories and standard notes. Finally, the most critical step is to generate the full 36-month `sip_projection_table_json`. I will iterate month by month, applying the compound interest formula to the growing balance and adding the new SIP contribution, ensuring the final corpus aligns with the calculated inflation-adjusted target.",

The fund categories are specifically selected to manage risk within this framework: Large and Mid Cap funds for balanced equity growth, and Short Duration and Corporate Bond funds for stability and capital protection in the debt portion. However, this strategy carries notable market risk due to the short time horizon.",
            "detailed": "### Strategic Analysis of Asset Allocation for House Purchase Goal\n\nThis report provides a detailed justification for the asset allocation plan formulated for the user's goal of purchasing a house, valued at an inflation-adjusted target of approximately ₹2.35 Crores, within a 3-year (36-month) timeframe, and aligned with a 'moderate' risk appetite.\n\n#### 1. The Core Strategic Dilemma: Time Horizon vs. Growth Requirement\n\nThe central challenge of this financial plan lies in the inherent conflict between the short investment horizon and the need for substantial capital growth. A 3-year period is typically considered short-term in investment planning, a timeframe where capital preservation is paramount. Equity markets, the primary driver of high growth, can exhibit significant volatility over such periods. A market downturn in the second or third year could severely impact the final corpus.\n\nConversely, relying solely on low-risk debt instruments would likely yield returns insufficient to meet the ambitious target of ₹2.35 Crores with the calculated monthly SIP of ~₹5.62 Lakhs. The plan assumes a 10% annualized return, a target that is difficult to achieve without significant equity exposure. Therefore, the strategy must navigate this dilemma by carefully balancing growth aspirations with risk management.\n\n#### 2. Rationale for the 50% Equity / 50% Debt Allocation\n\nThe 50/50 split between equity and debt is a direct implementation of the 'moderate' risk profile. It is not an arbitrary choice but a structured attempt to resolve the aforementioned dilemma.\n\n*   **The Growth Engine (50% Equity):** This portion of the portfolio is designed to generate the higher returns necessary to reach the financial goal. By investing in the stock market, the portfolio is positioned to outpace inflation and compound capital more aggressively than debt instruments alone. This exposure is what makes the 10% projected annual return a plausible target. It directly caters to the user's willingness to accept moderate risk for the potential of higher rewards.\n\n*   **The Stability Anchor (50% Debt):** This component is the risk-mitigation core of the strategy. With a fixed, non-negotiable 3-year deadline, protecting the accumulated capital from market shocks is critically important. The debt allocation acts as a buffer, reducing the overall volatility of the portfolio. In a scenario where the equity market performs poorly, this segment is expected to remain stable or provide modest positive returns, thus preserving a significant portion of the capital and preventing catastrophic losses near the goal's completion date.\n\nThis balanced mix seeks to provide a smoother investment journey than a pure equity portfolio while still offering a higher growth potential than a pure debt portfolio, making it a suitable, albeit aggressive, strategy for the given constraints.\n\n#### 3. Justification of Recommended Fund Categories\n\nThe selection of specific fund categories within the equity and debt allocations is crucial for fine-tuning the risk-return profile.\n\n**Equity Allocation (50% of Portfolio):**\n*   **Large Cap Funds:** These funds invest in the largest, most established companies in the market. They typically offer more stability and lower volatility compared to smaller companies. Allocating a significant portion of the equity investment here provides a foundational layer of growth with managed risk.\n*   **Mid Cap Funds:** These funds invest in mid-sized companies that often have higher growth potential than large caps. Including them adds a performance catalyst to the portfolio, essential for targeting the 10% return. The blend of Large and Mid Cap funds creates a diversified equity base that balances stability with aggressive growth.\n\n*Note on Omission:* Small Cap funds, while offering the highest growth potential, are deliberately excluded. Their extreme volatility makes them unsuitable for a short 3-year investment horizon where a sharp correction could be irrecoverable.\n\n**Debt Allocation (50% of Portfolio):**\n*   **Short Duration Funds:** This is arguably the most critical fund choice for this plan. These funds invest in debt instruments with short maturities (typically 1-3 years). Their primary advantage is low sensitivity to interest rate changes (duration risk). For a 3-year goal, this minimizes the risk that the fund's value will drop if interest rates rise, making them an ideal vehicle for capital preservation over this specific timeframe.\n*   **Corporate Bond Funds:** These funds invest in debt issued by corporations and generally offer higher yields (returns) than government securities, albeit with slightly higher credit risk. Their inclusion provides a modest return enhancement to the debt portion, helping the overall portfolio inch closer to its target return while maintaining a relatively low-risk profile.\n\n#### 4. Acknowledgment of Data Limitations and Inherent Risks\n\nIt is important to note that the upstream process for retrieving detailed, real-time fund category performance data (Task T012) failed. Therefore, this strategic analysis is based on the well-established, general characteristics of these fund categories rather than specific, current market data.\n\nThe primary risk of this strategy remains the **market risk** associated with a 50% equity exposure over just three years. The projected outcome is based on a smooth, average return of 10%, but reality is often different. The user must be prepared for the possibility that the final corpus may be lower than the target if the equity markets experience a downturn during the investment period. A contingency plan, such as extending the investment horizon or being prepared to make a larger down payment from other sources, should be considered.",
