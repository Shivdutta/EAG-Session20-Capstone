Monitor debt fund performance and duration.\n- **Final Phase**: Years 8-10: Gradually de-risk by shifting a portion of equity gains to lower-duration debt or liquid funds to protect the corpus from market volatility as the goal nears.\n- **Additional Considerations**: The primary objective is capital appreciation. Regular annual portfolio reviews are critical to ensure alignment with the 10% target return and to rebalance if the 50/50 allocation drifts significantly.\n\n## 📋 DO (STEP-BY-STEP)\n\n1. **Input Normalization** → Emit `fund_input_profile_json`\n2. **Fund Data Retrieval** → Call RetrieverAgent for goal-specific fund datasets  \n3. **Performance Analysis** → Refer \"Performance & Risk Computation\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n4. **Risk-Weighted Scoring** → Refer \"Ranking Algorithm\" from FundRecommendationAgent  \n5. **Fund Selection** → Refer \"Goal-Optimized Selection\" from FundRecommendationAgent\n6. **Output Generation** → Emit structured fund recommendation JSONs\n\n**Fund Category Guidelines for Moderate (General Wealth Creation):**\n```json\n{\n  \"category_guidelines\": {\n    \"equity_allocation\": {\n      \"categories\": [\"Large Cap Funds\", \"Mid Cap Funds\"],\n      \"strategy\": \"Core allocation to large-caps for stability, supplemented by mid-caps for higher growth potential.

The strategy includes a phased implementation plan, a clear rebalancing framework, and actionable tax optimization techniques to maximize the potential for achieving the inflation-adjusted target corpus.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\n### 1. Introduction and Investment Objective\n\nThis investment strategy is designed to address the financial goal of 'General Wealth Creation' over a 10-year time horizon for an investor with a 'Moderate' risk appetite. The plan is based on a required monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of ₹83,387.22, targeting an inflation-adjusted corpus of ₹1.71 crore. The strategy is built upon a balanced asset allocation of 50% in equity for growth and 50% in debt for stability, aligning with the specified risk profile.\n\n### 2. Portfolio Construction & Asset Allocation Rationale\n\nThe cornerstone of this strategy is a diversified, balanced portfolio constructed using a 'Core-Satellite' approach. This methodology provides a stable foundation while allowing for targeted exposure to higher-growth assets.\n\n**Asset Allocation:**\n- **Equity:** 50% of the portfolio is allocated to equity mutual funds to drive capital appreciation and outpace inflation over the long term.\n- **Debt:** 50% is allocated to debt mutual funds to provide stability, generate regular income, and cushion the portfolio against equity market volatility.\n\n**Core-Satellite Logic:**\n- **Core Holdings (60%):** The 'Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund' (35%) and 'HDFC Corporate Bond Fund' (25%) form the portfolio's core. The large-cap fund invests in established, blue-chip companies, offering relatively stable growth. The corporate bond fund provides predictable returns from high-quality debt instruments.\n- **Satellite Holdings (40%):** The 'PGIM India Midcap Opportunities Fund' (15%) serves as the primary growth satellite, investing in mid-sized companies with higher growth potential. The 'Axis Short Term Fund' (25%) acts as a stability satellite within the debt portion, minimizing interest rate risk and enhancing liquidity.\n\n### 3. Recommended Fund Portfolio\n\nThe following four funds have been selected based on their strong performance, superior risk-adjusted returns, and alignment with the investment objective. The monthly SIP of ₹83,387.22 shall be allocated as follows:\n\n| Fund Name                             | Category          | Allocation % | Monthly SIP Amount (₹) |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| **Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund**        | Large Cap Equity  | 35.0%        | 29,185.53                |\n| **PGIM India Midcap Opp. Fund**       | Mid Cap Equity    | 15.0%        | 12,508.08                |\n| **HDFC Corporate Bond Fund**          | Corporate Bond    | 25.0%        | 20,846.81                |\n| **Axis Short Term Fund**              | Short Duration    | 25.0%        | 20,846.81                |\n| **Total**                             |                   | **100.0%**   | **83,387.23**            |\n\n### 4. Phased Implementation & De-risking Roadmap\n\nA 10-year horizon allows for a structured, three-phase approach to maximize growth while preserving capital as the goal nears.\n\n*   **Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1-7):**\n    *   **Action:** Start the SIPs across all four funds as per the recommended allocation from the first month. The primary focus during this phase is disciplined accumulation and leveraging the power of compounding.\n    *   **Rationale:** This long initial phase allows the equity component to navigate market cycles and deliver its growth potential. Consistent investment is key.\n\n*   **Phase 2: Consolidation & Gradual De-risking (Years 8-9):**\n    *   **Action:** Continue the monthly SIPs. At the beginning of Year 8, begin to systematically shift a portion of the equity holdings to the debt funds. A practical approach is to use a Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) to move 15% of the accumulated equity value to the debt funds (split between Corporate Bond and Short Duration) each year.\n    *   **Rationale:** This proactive de-risking reduces the portfolio's vulnerability to a sharp market correction just before the target date, helping to lock in gains.\n\n*   **Phase 3: Capital Preservation (Year 10):**\n    *   **Action:** In the final year, accelerate the de-risking process. Move an additional 20-25% of the remaining equity holdings to the Short Duration and other liquid/overnight funds. The monthly SIPs can also be redirected entirely towards the debt funds.\n    *   **Rationale:** The primary objective in the final year is to protect the accumulated corpus from any market volatility. Growth becomes secondary to capital preservation.\n\n### 5. Monitoring & Rebalancing Framework\n\nDisciplined monitoring and rebalancing are critical to ensure the portfolio remains aligned with its strategic asset allocation.\n\n*   **Monitoring Schedule:** Review the portfolio performance on a quarterly basis to stay informed. Conduct a comprehensive annual review to assess performance against benchmarks (e.g., Nifty 100 for large-cap, Nifty Midcap 150 for mid-cap) and re-evaluate the fund's continued suitability.\n*   **Rebalancing Strategy:** A hybrid approach is recommended:\n    1.  **Time-Based:** Review the asset allocation during the annual review.\n    2.  **Trigger-Based:** If at any point the allocation between Equity and Debt deviates by more than 5% from the 50/50 target (e.g., becomes 55/45), a rebalancing action is triggered.\n    *   **Execution:** Rebalancing should first be attempted by redirecting the monthly SIPs to the underweight asset class. This is the most cost-effective method as it avoids selling and incurring taxes or exit loads. Only if this is insufficient should you consider selling from the overweight asset class to buy into the underweight one.\n\n### 6. Tax Optimization Strategies\n\nEffective tax planning can significantly enhance the final corpus.\n\n*   **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) on Equity:** All equity fund units should be held for a minimum of 12 months. Gains from selling units held for over a year are classified as LTCG. Gains up to ₹1 lakh per financial year are tax-free, and any amount above that is taxed at a concessional rate of 10%. The 10-year horizon is ideally suited to leverage this.\n*   **Debt Fund Taxation:** Gains from debt funds held for more than 36 months are taxed at 20% after indexation, which adjusts the purchase price for inflation, thereby reducing the taxable gain. Short-term gains (held <36 months) are added to your income and taxed at your applicable slab rate. Plan redemptions from debt funds to maximize the holding period beyond three years.\n*   **Tax Harvesting:** Where feasible, consider booking tax-free LTCG of up to ₹1 lakh each financial year by selling and reinvesting a portion of your equity funds. This resets the cost basis higher and reduces future tax liability.\n*   **ELSS Consideration (Optional):** If you have an unutilized limit under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, you could consider redirecting a portion of the large-cap allocation (up to ₹1.5 lakh annually) into a top-performing Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) fund to gain tax deductions.\n\n### 7. Risk Management & Disclaimer\n\nAll investments carry risk. This portfolio is exposed to **Market Risk**, where equity values can fall, and **Interest Rate Risk**, affecting debt fund returns. The provided diversification and long-term horizon are designed to mitigate these risks. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the **Data Limitation Risk**: this recommendation is based on a static, historical dataset from T020. A critical data retrieval step (T021) failed, preventing any fresh qualitative analysis. The investor must conduct their own due diligence with current fund information before investing. Past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.",

Past performance is not indicative of future results.</div><p>While this portfolio is designed for a 'Moderate' risk profile, all investments carry inherent risks. It is crucial to understand and be prepared for them. The primary risks for this portfolio include: <b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% equity allocation, particularly the 15% in mid-caps, will be subject to market volatility. Economic downturns, geopolitical events, or sector-specific headwinds can cause short-term valuation declines. The long 10-year horizon is the primary mitigating factor, allowing time for recovery from market cycles. <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Debt fund values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. If rates rise, the NAV of the HDFC Corporate Bond Fund could experience temporary declines. The inclusion of the Axis Short Term Fund, which has a lower duration and is thus less sensitive to rate changes, helps to buffer this risk. <b>Credit Risk:</b> The corporate bond fund invests in debt issued by companies. While it focuses on high-quality issuers, there is always a remote risk of a company defaulting on its payments, which would impact the fund's NAV. <b>Liquidity Risk:</b> In extreme market stress, selling units of mid-cap or corporate bond funds might become difficult. However, for regulated mutual funds in this category, this risk is generally low under normal market conditions.</p></section><section id='implementation-roadmap'><h2>🗺️ Phased Implementation Roadmap (10-Year Horizon)</h2><p>A structured, three-phase approach will be used to maximize growth while protecting capital as the goal approaches.</p><h3>Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1-7)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> Immediately commence the monthly SIPs across all four funds as per the recommended allocation. The focus is on disciplined, consistent investment to harness the power of compounding and navigate market cycles effectively.</p><h3>Phase 2: Consolidation & Gradual De-risking (Years 8-9)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> Continue the SIPs. At the start of Year 8, begin a systematic transfer of a portion of the equity corpus to the debt funds. A Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) is recommended to move approximately 15% of the accumulated equity value to the debt funds each year to lock in gains and reduce volatility.</p><h3>Phase 3: Capital Preservation (Year 10)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> In the final year, the primary objective shifts from growth to capital protection. Accelerate the de-risking by moving a larger portion (20-25%) of the remaining equity holdings to the Short Duration fund. Monthly SIPs can also be redirected entirely to the debt funds.</p></section><section id='comparison-charts'><h2>📊 Portfolio Visualizations</h2><div class='charts-grid' style='display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(400px, 1fr)); gap: 20px;'><div><h3>Fund Performance Comparison</h3><canvas id='performanceChart'></canvas></div><div><h3>Risk vs. Return Analysis</h3><canvas id='riskReturnChart'></canvas></div><div><h3>Strategic Asset Allocation</h3><canvas id='allocationDoughnutChart'></canvas></div><div><h3>Portfolio Sub-Category Breakdown</h3><canvas id='allocationBarChart'></canvas></div></div><script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js'></script><script id='fundChartData' type='application/json'>{\"performance_comparison\":{\"type\":\"bar\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Mirae Large Cap\",\"PGIM Midcap\",\"HDFC Corp Bond\",\"Axis Short Term\"],\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"3Y CAGR (%)\",\"data\":[19,25,6.5,6.1],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.6)\"},{\"label\":\"5Y CAGR (%)\",\"data\":[17,21,7,6.5],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.6)\"}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Recommended Fund Performance Comparison\"}},\"scales\":{\"y\":{\"beginAtZero\":true,\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Annualized Return (%)\"}}}}},\"risk_return_scatter\":{\"type\":\"scatter\",\"data\":{\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"Screened Funds\",\"data\":[{\"x\":0.19,\"y\":18,\"fundName\":\"Axis Bluechip Fund\"},{\"x\":0.2,\"y\":19,\"fundName\":\"Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund\"},{\"x\":0.24,\"y\":25,\"fundName\":\"PGIM India Midcap Opportunities Fund\"},{\"x\":0.25,\"y\":24,\"fundName\":\"Kotak Emerging Equity Fund\"},{\"x\":0.03,\"y\":6.5,\"fundName\":\"HDFC Corporate Bond Fund\"},{\"x\":0.035,\"y\":6.2,\"fundName\":\"ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund\"},{\"x\":0.02,\"y\":6,\"fundName\":\"SBI Short Term Debt Fund\"},{\"x\":0.018,\"y\":6.1,\"fundName\":\"Axis Short Term Fund\"}],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.8)\"}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Risk vs. Return Analysis (Volatility vs. 3Y CAGR)\"},\"tooltip\":{\"callbacks\":{\"label\":function(context){return context.raw.fundName + ': (Risk: ' + context.raw.x + ', Return: ' + context.raw.y + '%)';}}}},\"scales\":{\"x\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Risk (Standard Deviation)\"}},\"y\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Return (3Y CAGR %)\"}}}}},\"portfolio_allocation\":{\"asset_class\":{\"type\":\"doughnut\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Equity\",\"Debt\"],\"datasets\":[{\"data\":[50,50],\"backgroundColor\":[\"#3B82F6\",\"#10B981\"]}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Strategic Asset Allocation (Equity vs. Debt)\"}}}},\"sub_category\":{\"type\":\"bar\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Large Cap\",\"Mid Cap\",\"Corporate Bond\",\"Short Duration\"],\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"Allocation %\",\"data\":[35,15,25,25],\"backgroundColor\":[\"#3B82F6\",\"#60A5FA\",\"#10B981\",\"#34D399\"]}]},\"options\":{\"indexAxis\":\"y\",\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"legend\":{\"display\":false},\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Portfolio Sub-Category Breakdown\"}},\"scales\":{\"x\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"% of Total Portfolio\"}}}}}},\"expense_ratio_comparison\":{\"type\":\"bar\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Mirae Large Cap\",\"PGIM Midcap\",\"HDFC Corp Bond\",\"Axis Short Term\"],\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"Expense Ratio (%)\",\"data\":[0.49,0.42,0.28,0.3],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.6)\"}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Expense Ratio Comparison (Recommended Funds)\"}},\"scales\":{\"y\":{\"beginAtZero\":true,\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Expense Ratio (%)\"}}}}}}</script><script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() { try { const chartData = JSON.parse(document.getElementById('fundChartData').textContent); new Chart(document.getElementById('performanceChart').getContext('2d'), chartData.performance_comparison); new Chart(document.getElementById('riskReturnChart').getContext('2d'), chartData.risk_return_scatter); new Chart(document.getElementById('allocationDoughnutChart').getContext('2d'), chartData.portfolio_allocation.asset_class); new Chart(document.getElementById('allocationBarChart').getContext('2d'), chartData.portfolio_allocation.sub_category); } catch (e) { console.error('Error rendering charts:', e); } });</script></section><section id='rebalancing-strategy'><h2>⚖️ Portfolio Monitoring & Rebalancing Strategy</h2><p>Disciplined oversight is crucial to keep the portfolio aligned with its goals. We recommend a hybrid time- and trigger-based rebalancing approach:</p><ul><li><b>Monitoring Schedule:</b> Perform a high-level review of the portfolio quarterly. Conduct a comprehensive, formal review annually to assess performance against benchmarks (e.g., Nifty 100, Nifty Midcap 150) and evaluate fund suitability.</li><li><b>Rebalancing Trigger:</b> A rebalancing action is required under two conditions: (1) during the annual review, or (2) if the strategic 50/50 Equity-Debt allocation drifts by more than 5% (e.g., becomes 55/45 or 45/55).</li><li><b>Execution Method:</b> The most cost-effective method is to use new SIP contributions to rebalance. Direct the full monthly SIP amount to the underweight asset class until the target allocation is restored. This avoids potential transaction costs, exit loads, and tax events associated with selling units.</li></ul></section><section id='tax-optimization'><h2>💰 Tax Optimization Strategies</h2><p>Effective tax planning can significantly enhance the final corpus. Key strategies include:</p><ul><li><b>Leverage Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</b> All equity investments should be held for over one year. Gains on units held longer than 12 months are taxed at a favorable 10% rate, only on gains exceeding ₹1 lakh per financial year. The 10-year horizon is ideal for this.</li><li><b>Understand Debt Taxation:</b> Gains from debt funds held for more than 3 years benefit from indexation, which lowers the taxable amount. Plan any major redemptions from debt funds to exceed this 36-month holding period.</li><li><b>Consider Tax Harvesting:</b> Where appropriate, you can book tax-free LTCG up to ₹1 lakh each year by selling and reinvesting equity fund units.

A critical data retrieval step for fresh qualitative information (e.g., fund manager changes, latest portfolio churn) failed. Investors must conduct their own due diligence with current fund factsheets before investing. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</div><p>While this portfolio is designed for a 'Moderate' risk profile, all investments carry inherent risks. It is crucial to understand and be prepared for them. The primary risks for this portfolio include: <b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% equity allocation, particularly the 15% in mid-caps, will be subject to market volatility. Economic downturns, geopolitical events, or sector-specific headwinds can cause short-term valuation declines. The long 10-year horizon is the primary mitigating factor, allowing time for recovery from market cycles. <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Debt fund values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. If rates rise, the NAV of the HDFC Corporate Bond Fund could experience temporary declines. The inclusion of the Axis Short Term Fund, which has a lower duration and is thus less sensitive to rate changes, helps to buffer this risk. <b>Credit Risk:</b> The corporate bond fund invests in debt issued by companies. While it focuses on high-quality issuers, there is always a remote risk of a company defaulting on its payments, which would impact the fund's NAV. <b>Liquidity Risk:</b> In extreme market stress, selling units of mid-cap or corporate bond funds might become difficult. However, for regulated mutual funds in this category, this risk is generally low under normal market conditions.</p></section>\n    <section id='implementation-roadmap'><h2>🗺️ Phased Implementation Roadmap (10-Year Horizon)</h2><p>A structured, three-phase approach will be used to maximize growth while protecting capital as the goal approaches.</p><h3>Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1-7)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> Immediately commence the monthly SIPs across all four funds as per the recommended allocation. The focus is on disciplined, consistent investment to harness the power of compounding and navigate market cycles effectively.</p><h3>Phase 2: Consolidation & Gradual De-risking (Years 8-9)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> Continue the SIPs. At the start of Year 8, begin a systematic transfer of a portion of the equity corpus to the debt funds. A Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) is recommended to move approximately 15% of the accumulated equity value to the debt funds each year to lock in gains and reduce volatility.</p><h3>Phase 3: Capital Preservation (Year 10)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> In the final year, the primary objective shifts from growth to capital protection. Accelerate the de-risking by moving a larger portion (20-25%) of the remaining equity holdings to the Short Duration fund. Monthly SIPs can also be redirected entirely to the debt funds.</p></section>\n    <section id='rebalancing-strategy'><h2>⚖️ Portfolio Monitoring & Rebalancing Strategy</h2><p>Disciplined oversight is crucial to keep the portfolio aligned with its goals. We recommend a hybrid time- and trigger-based rebalancing approach:</p><ul><li><b>Monitoring Schedule:</b> Perform a high-level review of the portfolio quarterly. Conduct a comprehensive, formal review annually to assess performance against benchmarks (e.g., Nifty 100, Nifty Midcap 150) and evaluate fund suitability.</li><li><b>Rebalancing Trigger:</b> A rebalancing action is required under two conditions: (1) during the annual review, or (2) if the strategic 50/50 Equity-Debt allocation drifts by more than 5% (e.g., becomes 55/45 or 45/55).</li><li><b>Execution Method:</b> The most cost-effective method is to use new SIP contributions to rebalance. Direct the full monthly SIP amount to the underweight asset class until the target allocation is restored. This avoids potential transaction costs, exit loads, and tax events associated with selling units.</li></ul></section>\n    <section id='tax-optimization'><h2>💰 Tax Optimization Strategies</h2><p>Effective tax planning can significantly enhance the final corpus. Key strategies include:</p><ul><li><b>Leverage Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</b> All equity investments should be held for over one year. Gains on units held longer than 12 months are taxed at a favorable 10% rate, only on gains exceeding ₹1 lakh per financial year. The 10-year horizon is ideal for this.</li><li><b>Understand Debt Taxation:</b> Gains from debt funds held for more than 3 years benefit from indexation, which lowers the taxable amount. Plan any major redemptions from debt funds to exceed this 36-month holding period.</li><li><b>Consider Tax Harvesting:</b> Where appropriate, you can book tax-free LTCG up to ₹1 lakh each year by selling and reinvesting equity fund units. This resets the purchase price higher, reducing future tax liability.</li><li><b>Optional ELSS Integration:</b> If you have an unutilized limit under Section 80C, a portion of the large-cap allocation could be channeled into an ELSS fund to claim tax deductions.</li></ul></section>\n    <section id='timeline-scenarios'><h2>⏳ Goal Timeline Scenarios</h2><p>While the plan is built on a 10% expected return over 10 years, market performance can vary. It's prudent to consider potential scenarios:</p><ul><li><b>Bull Market Scenario (Outperformance):</b> If the portfolio consistently generates returns significantly above 12-14%, the target corpus might be reached ahead of the 10-year schedule (e.g., in 8-9 years). In this case, you could choose to de-risk earlier and shift the entire corpus to safer debt instruments, or continue investing towards a larger final amount.</li><li><b>Bear Market Scenario (Underperformance):</b> If a prolonged market downturn results in returns significantly below the 10% assumption, the projected corpus may fall short.

Your task is to process this input and generate a comprehensive fund recommendation strategy. GOAL CONTEXT: General Wealth Creation planning with a 10-year time horizon, 'Moderate' risk tolerance, and a ₹83,387.22 monthly investment capacity. TARGET: ₹1,70,81,444.57 inflation-adjusted corpus. FUND SELECTION PRIORITY: The primary objective is capital appreciation. Apply a phased strategy: Years 1-3 (Core Accumulation: large/mid-cap equity, corporate bonds), Years 4-7 (Diversification: potential flexi-cap addition), Years 8-10 (De-risking: shift to lower-duration debt). PROCESSING: (1) Normalize the provided SIP input. (2) Apply goal-adaptive fund categorization based on the provided guidelines (Equity: Large/Mid Cap; Debt: Corporate/Short Duration). (3) Use the 'Moderate' risk profile to apply scoring weights (cagr: 0.25, sharpe: 0.25, etc.). (4) Generate initial fund screening parameters. OUTPUT: `fund_master_json`, `fund_screening_json`, `fund_ranking_json`, `fund_explain_json`. Ensure all outputs are in STRICT JSON format. INPUT DATA: Use the 'investment_profile', 'asset_allocation', and 'portfolio_requirements' JSON provided in the user query.",

The strategy includes a phased implementation plan, a clear rebalancing framework, and actionable tax optimization techniques to maximize the potential for achieving the inflation-adjusted target corpus.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\n### 1. Introduction and Investment Objective\n\nThis investment strategy is designed to address the financial goal of 'General Wealth Creation' over a 10-year time horizon for an investor with a 'Moderate' risk appetite. The plan is based on a required monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of ₹83,387.22, targeting an inflation-adjusted corpus of ₹1.71 crore. The strategy is built upon a balanced asset allocation of 50% in equity for growth and 50% in debt for stability, aligning with the specified risk profile.\n\n### 2. Portfolio Construction & Asset Allocation Rationale\n\nThe cornerstone of this strategy is a diversified, balanced portfolio constructed using a 'Core-Satellite' approach. This methodology provides a stable foundation while allowing for targeted exposure to higher-growth assets.\n\n**Asset Allocation:**\n- **Equity:** 50% of the portfolio is allocated to equity mutual funds to drive capital appreciation and outpace inflation over the long term.\n- **Debt:** 50% is allocated to debt mutual funds to provide stability, generate regular income, and cushion the portfolio against equity market volatility.\n\n**Core-Satellite Logic:**\n- **Core Holdings (60%):** The 'Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund' (35%) and 'HDFC Corporate Bond Fund' (25%) form the portfolio's core. The large-cap fund invests in established, blue-chip companies, offering relatively stable growth. The corporate bond fund provides predictable returns from high-quality debt instruments.\n- **Satellite Holdings (40%):** The 'PGIM India Midcap Opportunities Fund' (15%) serves as the primary growth satellite, investing in mid-sized companies with higher growth potential. The 'Axis Short Term Fund' (25%) acts as a stability satellite within the debt portion, minimizing interest rate risk and enhancing liquidity.\n\n### 3. Recommended Fund Portfolio\n\nThe following four funds have been selected based on their strong performance, superior risk-adjusted returns, and alignment with the investment objective. The monthly SIP of ₹83,387.22 shall be allocated as follows:\n\n| Fund Name                             | Category          | Allocation % | Monthly SIP Amount (₹) |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| **Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund**        | Large Cap Equity  | 35.0%        | 29,185.53                |\n| **PGIM India Midcap Opp. Fund**       | Mid Cap Equity    | 15.0%        | 12,508.08                |\n| **HDFC Corporate Bond Fund**          | Corporate Bond    | 25.0%        | 20,846.81                |\n| **Axis Short Term Fund**              | Short Duration    | 25.0%        | 20,846.81                |\n| **Total**                             |                   | **100.0%**   | **83,387.23**            |\n\n### 4. Phased Implementation & De-risking Roadmap\n\nA 10-year horizon allows for a structured, three-phase approach to maximize growth while preserving capital as the goal nears.\n\n*   **Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1-7):**\n    *   **Action:** Start the SIPs across all four funds as per the recommended allocation from the first month. The primary focus during this phase is disciplined accumulation and leveraging the power of compounding.\n    *   **Rationale:** This long initial phase allows the equity component to navigate market cycles and deliver its growth potential. Consistent investment is key.\n\n*   **Phase 2: Consolidation & Gradual De-risking (Years 8-9):**\n    *   **Action:** Continue the monthly SIPs. At the beginning of Year 8, begin to systematically shift a portion of the equity holdings to the debt funds. A practical approach is to use a Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) to move 15% of the accumulated equity value to the debt funds (split between Corporate Bond and Short Duration) each year.\n    *   **Rationale:** This proactive de-risking reduces the portfolio's vulnerability to a sharp market correction just before the target date, helping to lock in gains.\n\n*   **Phase 3: Capital Preservation (Year 10):**\n    *   **Action:** In the final year, accelerate the de-risking process. Move an additional 20-25% of the remaining equity holdings to the Short Duration and other liquid/overnight funds. The monthly SIPs can also be redirected entirely towards the debt funds.\n    *   **Rationale:** The primary objective in the final year is to protect the accumulated corpus from any market volatility. Growth becomes secondary to capital preservation.\n\n### 5. Monitoring & Rebalancing Framework\n\nDisciplined monitoring and rebalancing are critical to ensure the portfolio remains aligned with its strategic asset allocation.\n\n*   **Monitoring Schedule:** Review the portfolio performance on a quarterly basis to stay informed. Conduct a comprehensive annual review to assess performance against benchmarks (e.g., Nifty 100 for large-cap, Nifty Midcap 150 for mid-cap) and re-evaluate the fund's continued suitability.\n*   **Rebalancing Strategy:** A hybrid approach is recommended:\n    1.  **Time-Based:** Review the asset allocation during the annual review.\n    2.  **Trigger-Based:** If at any point the allocation between Equity and Debt deviates by more than 5% from the 50/50 target (e.g., becomes 55/45), a rebalancing action is triggered.\n    *   **Execution:** Rebalancing should first be attempted by redirecting the monthly SIPs to the underweight asset class. This is the most cost-effective method as it avoids selling and incurring taxes or exit loads. Only if this is insufficient should you consider selling from the overweight asset class to buy into the underweight one.\n\n### 6. Tax Optimization Strategies\n\nEffective tax planning can significantly enhance the final corpus.\n\n*   **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) on Equity:** All equity fund units should be held for a minimum of 12 months. Gains from selling units held for over a year are classified as LTCG. Gains up to ₹1 lakh per financial year are tax-free, and any amount above that is taxed at a concessional rate of 10%. The 10-year horizon is ideally suited to leverage this.\n*   **Debt Fund Taxation:** Gains from debt funds held for more than 36 months are taxed at 20% after indexation, which adjusts the purchase price for inflation, thereby reducing the taxable gain. Short-term gains (held <36 months) are added to your income and taxed at your applicable slab rate. Plan redemptions from debt funds to maximize the holding period beyond three years.\n*   **Tax Harvesting:** Where feasible, consider booking tax-free LTCG of up to ₹1 lakh each financial year by selling and reinvesting a portion of your equity funds. This resets the cost basis higher and reduces future tax liability.\n*   **ELSS Consideration (Optional):** If you have an unutilized limit under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, you could consider redirecting a portion of the large-cap allocation (up to ₹1.5 lakh annually) into a top-performing Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) fund to gain tax deductions.\n\n### 7. Risk Management & Disclaimer\n\nAll investments carry risk. This portfolio is exposed to **Market Risk**, where equity values can fall, and **Interest Rate Risk**, affecting debt fund returns. The provided diversification and long-term horizon are designed to mitigate these risks. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the **Data Limitation Risk**: this recommendation is based on a static, historical dataset from T020. A critical data retrieval step (T021) failed, preventing any fresh qualitative analysis. The investor must conduct their own due diligence with current fund information before investing.

I will pay special attention to the issues raised by the validator in `T023`, such as ensuring the Risk Analysis section exceeds 150 words, creating the missing 'Goal Timeline Scenarios' section, and correcting the minor rounding error in the monthly investment total.

I will structure the report logically, starting with a high-level summary and progressively diving into the specifics of fund selection, portfolio construction, risk management, and long-term strategy.

A critical data retrieval step for fresh qualitative information (e.g., fund manager changes, latest portfolio churn) failed. Investors must conduct their own due diligence with current fund factsheets before investing. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</div><p>While this portfolio is designed for a 'Moderate' risk profile, all investments carry inherent risks. It is crucial to understand and be prepared for them. The primary risks for this portfolio include: <b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% equity allocation, particularly the 15% in mid-caps, will be subject to market volatility. Economic downturns, geopolitical events, or sector-specific headwinds can cause short-term valuation declines. The long 10-year horizon is the primary mitigating factor, allowing time for recovery from market cycles. <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Debt fund values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. If rates rise, the NAV of the HDFC Corporate Bond Fund could experience temporary declines. The inclusion of the Axis Short Term Fund, which has a lower duration and is thus less sensitive to rate changes, helps to buffer this risk. <b>Credit Risk:</b> The corporate bond fund invests in debt issued by companies. While it focuses on high-quality issuers, there is always a remote risk of a company defaulting on its payments, which would impact the fund's NAV. <b>Liquidity Risk:</b> In extreme market stress, selling units of mid-cap or corporate bond funds might become difficult. However, for regulated mutual funds in this category, this risk is generally low under normal market conditions.</p></section><section id='implementation-roadmap'><h2>🗺️ Phased Implementation Roadmap (10-Year Horizon)</h2><p>A structured, three-phase approach will be used to maximize growth while protecting capital as the goal approaches.</p><h3>Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1-7)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> Immediately commence the monthly SIPs across all four funds as per the recommended allocation. The focus is on disciplined, consistent investment to harness the power of compounding and navigate market cycles effectively.</p><h3>Phase 2: Consolidation & Gradual De-risking (Years 8-9)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> Continue the SIPs. At the start of Year 8, begin a systematic transfer of a portion of the equity corpus to the debt funds. A Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) is recommended to move approximately 15% of the accumulated equity value to the debt funds each year to lock in gains and reduce volatility.</p><h3>Phase 3: Capital Preservation (Year 10)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> In the final year, the primary objective shifts from growth to capital protection. Accelerate the de-risking by moving a larger portion (20-25%) of the remaining equity holdings to the Short Duration fund. Monthly SIPs can also be redirected entirely to the debt funds.</p></section><section id='comparison-charts'><h2>📊 Portfolio Visualizations</h2><div class='charts-grid' style='display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(400px, 1fr)); gap: 20px;'><div><h3>Fund Performance Comparison</h3><canvas id='performanceChart'></canvas></div><div><h3>Risk vs. Return Analysis</h3><canvas id='riskReturnChart'></canvas></div><div><h3>Strategic Asset Allocation</h3><canvas id='allocationDoughnutChart'></canvas></div><div><h3>Portfolio Sub-Category Breakdown</h3><canvas id='allocationBarChart'></canvas></div></div><script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js'></script><script id='fundChartData' type='application/json'>{\"performance_comparison\":{\"type\":\"bar\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Mirae Large Cap\",\"PGIM Midcap\",\"HDFC Corp Bond\",\"Axis Short Term\"],\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"3Y CAGR (%)\",\"data\":[19,25,6.5,6.1],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.6)\"},{\"label\":\"5Y CAGR (%)\",\"data\":[17,21,7,6.5],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.6)\"}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Recommended Fund Performance Comparison\"}},\"scales\":{\"y\":{\"beginAtZero\":true,\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Annualized Return (%)\"}}}}},\"risk_return_scatter\":{\"type\":\"scatter\",\"data\":{\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"Screened Funds\",\"data\":[{\"x\":0.19,\"y\":18,\"fundName\":\"Axis Bluechip Fund\"},{\"x\":0.2,\"y\":19,\"fundName\":\"Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund\"},{\"x\":0.24,\"y\":25,\"fundName\":\"PGIM India Midcap Opportunities Fund\"},{\"x\":0.25,\"y\":24,\"fundName\":\"Kotak Emerging Equity Fund\"},{\"x\":0.03,\"y\":6.5,\"fundName\":\"HDFC Corporate Bond Fund\"},{\"x\":0.035,\"y\":6.2,\"fundName\":\"ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund\"},{\"x\":0.02,\"y\":6,\"fundName\":\"SBI Short Term Debt Fund\"},{\"x\":0.018,\"y\":6.1,\"fundName\":\"Axis Short Term Fund\"}],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.8)\"}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Risk vs. Return Analysis (Volatility vs. 3Y CAGR)\"},\"tooltip\":{\"callbacks\":{\"label\":function(context){return context.raw.fundName + ': (Risk: ' + context.raw.x + ', Return: ' + context.raw.y + '%)';}}}},\"scales\":{\"x\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Risk (Standard Deviation)\"}},\"y\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Return (3Y CAGR %)\"}}}}},\"portfolio_allocation\":{\"asset_class\":{\"type\":\"doughnut\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Equity\",\"Debt\"],\"datasets\":[{\"data\":[50,50],\"backgroundColor\":[\"#3B82F6\",\"#10B981\"]}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Strategic Asset Allocation (Equity vs. Debt)\"}}}},\"sub_category\":{\"type\":\"bar\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Large Cap\",\"Mid Cap\",\"Corporate Bond\",\"Short Duration\"],\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"Allocation %\",\"data\":[35,15,25,25],\"backgroundColor\":[\"#3B82F6\",\"#60A5FA\",\"#10B981\",\"#34D399\"]}]},\"options\":{\"indexAxis\":\"y\",\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"legend\":{\"display\":false},\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Portfolio Sub-Category Breakdown\"}},\"scales\":{\"x\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"% of Total Portfolio\"}}}}}},\"expense_ratio_comparison\":{\"type\":\"bar\",\"data\":{\"labels\":[\"Mirae Large Cap\",\"PGIM Midcap\",\"HDFC Corp Bond\",\"Axis Short Term\"],\"datasets\":[{\"label\":\"Expense Ratio (%)\",\"data\":[0.49,0.42,0.28,0.3],\"backgroundColor\":\"rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.6)\"}]},\"options\":{\"responsive\":true,\"plugins\":{\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Expense Ratio Comparison (Recommended Funds)\"}},\"scales\":{\"y\":{\"beginAtZero\":true,\"title\":{\"display\":true,\"text\":\"Expense Ratio (%)\"}}}}}}</script><script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() { try { const chartData = JSON.parse(document.getElementById('fundChartData').textContent); new Chart(document.getElementById('performanceChart').getContext('2d'), chartData.performance_comparison); new Chart(document.getElementById('riskReturnChart').getContext('2d'), chartData.risk_return_scatter); new Chart(document.getElementById('allocationDoughnutChart').getContext('2d'), chartData.portfolio_allocation.asset_class); new Chart(document.getElementById('allocationBarChart').getContext('2d'), chartData.portfolio_allocation.sub_category); } catch (e) { console.error('Error rendering charts:', e); } });</script></section><section id='rebalancing-strategy'><h2>⚖️ Portfolio Monitoring & Rebalancing Strategy</h2><p>Disciplined oversight is crucial to keep the portfolio aligned with its goals. We recommend a hybrid time- and trigger-based rebalancing approach:</p><ul><li><b>Monitoring Schedule:</b> Perform a high-level review of the portfolio quarterly. Conduct a comprehensive, formal review annually to assess performance against benchmarks (e.g., Nifty 100, Nifty Midcap 150) and evaluate fund suitability.</li><li><b>Rebalancing Trigger:</b> A rebalancing action is required under two conditions: (1) during the annual review, or (2) if the strategic 50/50 Equity-Debt allocation drifts by more than 5% (e.g., becomes 55/45 or 45/55).</li><li><b>Execution Method:</b> The most cost-effective method is to use new SIP contributions to rebalance. Direct the full monthly SIP amount to the underweight asset class until the target allocation is restored. This avoids potential transaction costs, exit loads, and tax events associated with selling units.</li></ul></section><section id='tax-optimization'><h2>💰 Tax Optimization Strategies</h2><p>Effective tax planning can significantly enhance the final corpus. Key strategies include:</p><ul><li><b>Leverage Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</b> All equity investments should be held for over one year. Gains on units held longer than 12 months are taxed at a favorable 10% rate, only on gains exceeding ₹1 lakh per financial year. The 10-year horizon is ideal for this.</li><li><b>Understand Debt Taxation:</b> Gains from debt funds held for more than 3 years benefit from indexation, which lowers the taxable amount. Plan any major redemptions from debt funds to exceed this 36-month holding period.</li><li><b>Consider Tax Harvesting:</b> Where appropriate, you can book tax-free LTCG up to ₹1 lakh each year by selling and reinvesting equity fund units. This resets the purchase price higher, reducing future tax liability.</li><li><b>Optional ELSS Integration:</b> If you have an unutilized limit under Section 80C, a portion of the large-cap allocation could be channeled into an ELSS fund to claim tax deductions.</li></ul></section><section id='timeline-scenarios'><h2>⏳ Goal Timeline Scenarios</h2><p>While the plan is built on a 10% expected return over 10 years, market performance can vary. It's prudent to consider potential scenarios:</p><ul><li><b>Bull Market Scenario (Outperformance):</b> If the portfolio consistently generates returns significantly above 12-14%, the target corpus might be reached ahead of the 10-year schedule (e.g., in 8-9 years). In this case, you could choose to de-risk earlier and shift the entire corpus to safer debt instruments, or continue investing towards a larger final amount.</li><li><b>Bear Market Scenario (Underperformance):</b> If a prolonged market downturn results in returns significantly below the 10% assumption, the projected corpus may fall short. The response would depend on when this occurs. If early in the horizon, the best course is often to stay invested and continue the SIP to buy more units at lower prices. If this occurs closer to the goal, options include increasing the monthly SIP amount, extending the investment horizon by 1-2 years, or moderately adjusting the final corpus target.</li></ul></section><section id='image-debug'><h2>Image Integration Debug Log</h2><p>Scanned all data sources (`T020`, `T022`, `T023`, `T024`) for image objects containing 'url' and 'alt_text' fields.

It invests in India's largest and most established companies, aiming for stable, long-term growth and providing a defensive cushion during market downturns compared to smaller companies.</p><p><strong>PGIM India Midcap Opportunities Fund (15%):</strong> As the satellite growth component, this fund invests in fast-growing mid-sized companies. It offers higher return potential to accelerate wealth creation, albeit with higher volatility, which is manageable over a 10-year horizon.</p><h3>Debt Component (50%): The Stability Anchor</h3><p><strong>HDFC Corporate Bond Fund (25%):</strong> This fund provides the core of the debt allocation, investing in high-credit-quality corporate bonds. It aims to deliver better yields than government securities while maintaining a high degree of capital safety, providing a stable income stream to the portfolio.</p><p><strong>Axis Short Term Fund (25%):</strong> This fund complements the corporate bond fund by focusing on shorter-maturity debt instruments. Its primary role is to manage interest rate risk and provide liquidity, making the debt portion of the portfolio resilient to changes in the rate cycle.</p></section>\n    <section id='risk-analysis'><h2>⚠️ Risk Analysis & Considerations</h2><div class='callout warning'><b>Data Limitation Notice:</b> This recommendation is based on a static, historical dataset. A critical data retrieval step for fresh qualitative information (e.g., fund manager changes, latest portfolio churn) failed. Investors must conduct their own due diligence with current fund factsheets before investing. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</div><p>While this portfolio is designed for a 'Moderate' risk profile, all investments carry inherent risks. It is crucial to understand and be prepared for them. The primary risks for this portfolio include: <b>Market Risk:</b> The 50% equity allocation, particularly the 15% in mid-caps, will be subject to market volatility. Economic downturns, geopolitical events, or sector-specific headwinds can cause short-term valuation declines. The long 10-year horizon is the primary mitigating factor, allowing time for recovery from market cycles. <b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Debt fund values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. If rates rise, the NAV of the HDFC Corporate Bond Fund could experience temporary declines. The inclusion of the Axis Short Term Fund, which has a lower duration and is thus less sensitive to rate changes, helps to buffer this risk. <b>Credit Risk:</b> The corporate bond fund invests in debt issued by companies. While it focuses on high-quality issuers, there is always a remote risk of a company defaulting on its payments, which would impact the fund's NAV. <b>Liquidity Risk:</b> In extreme market stress, selling units of mid-cap or corporate bond funds might become difficult. However, for regulated mutual funds in this category, this risk is generally low under normal market conditions.</p></section>\n    <section id='implementation-roadmap'><h2>🗺️ Phased Implementation Roadmap (10-Year Horizon)</h2><p>A structured, three-phase approach will be used to maximize growth while protecting capital as the goal approaches.</p><h3>Phase 1: Accumulation (Years 1-7)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> Immediately commence the monthly SIPs across all four funds as per the recommended allocation. The focus is on disciplined, consistent investment to harness the power of compounding and navigate market cycles effectively.</p><h3>Phase 2: Consolidation & Gradual De-risking (Years 8-9)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> Continue the SIPs. At the start of Year 8, begin a systematic transfer of a portion of the equity corpus to the debt funds. A Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) is recommended to move approximately 15% of the accumulated equity value to the debt funds each year to lock in gains and reduce volatility.</p><h3>Phase 3: Capital Preservation (Year 10)</h3><p><b>Action:</b> In the final year, the primary objective shifts from growth to capital protection. Accelerate the de-risking by moving a larger portion (20-25%) of the remaining equity holdings to the Short Duration fund. Monthly SIPs can also be redirected entirely to the debt funds.</p></section>\n    <section id='rebalancing-strategy'><h2>⚖️ Portfolio Monitoring & Rebalancing Strategy</h2><p>Disciplined oversight is crucial to keep the portfolio aligned with its goals. We recommend a hybrid time- and trigger-based rebalancing approach:</p><ul><li><b>Monitoring Schedule:</b> Perform a high-level review of the portfolio quarterly. Conduct a comprehensive, formal review annually to assess performance against benchmarks (e.g., Nifty 100, Nifty Midcap 150) and evaluate fund suitability.</li><li><b>Rebalancing Trigger:</b> A rebalancing action is required under two conditions: (1) during the annual review, or (2) if the strategic 50/50 Equity-Debt allocation drifts by more than 5% (e.g., becomes 55/45 or 45/55).</li><li><b>Execution Method:</b> The most cost-effective method is to use new SIP contributions to rebalance. Direct the full monthly SIP amount to the underweight asset class until the target allocation is restored. This avoids potential transaction costs, exit loads, and tax events associated with selling units.</li></ul></section>\n    <section id='tax-optimization'><h2>💰 Tax Optimization Strategies</h2><p>Effective tax planning can significantly enhance the final corpus. Key strategies include:</p><ul><li><b>Leverage Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</b> All equity investments should be held for over one year. Gains on units held longer than 12 months are taxed at a favorable 10% rate, only on gains exceeding ₹1 lakh per financial year. The 10-year horizon is ideal for this.</li><li><b>Understand Debt Taxation:</b> Gains from debt funds held for more than 3 years benefit from indexation, which lowers the taxable amount. Plan any major redemptions from debt funds to exceed this 36-month holding period.</li><li><b>Consider Tax Harvesting:</b> Where appropriate, you can book tax-free LTCG up to ₹1 lakh each year by selling and reinvesting equity fund units. This resets the purchase price higher, reducing future tax liability.</li><li><b>Optional ELSS Integration:</b> If you have an unutilized limit under Section 80C, a portion of the large-cap allocation could be channeled into an ELSS fund to claim tax deductions.</li></ul></section>\n    <section id='timeline-scenarios'><h2>⏳ Goal Timeline Scenarios</h2><p>While the plan is built on a 10% expected return over 10 years, market performance can vary. It's prudent to consider potential scenarios:</p><ul><li><b>Bull Market Scenario (Outperformance):</b> If the portfolio consistently generates returns significantly above 12-14%, the target corpus might be reached ahead of the 10-year schedule (e.g., in 8-9 years). In this case, you could choose to de-risk earlier and shift the entire corpus to safer debt instruments, or continue investing towards a larger final amount.</li><li><b>Bear Market Scenario (Underperformance):</b> If a prolonged market downturn results in returns significantly below the 10% assumption, the projected corpus may fall short. The response would depend on when this occurs. If early in the horizon, the best course is often to stay invested and continue the SIP to buy more units at lower prices. If this occurs closer to the goal, options include increasing the monthly SIP amount, extending the investment horizon by 1-2 years, or moderately adjusting the final corpus target.</li></ul></section>\n    <section id='image-debug'><h2>Image Integration Debug Log</h2><p>Scanned all data sources (`T020`, `T022`, `T023`, `T024`) for image objects containing 'url' and 'alt_text' fields.
