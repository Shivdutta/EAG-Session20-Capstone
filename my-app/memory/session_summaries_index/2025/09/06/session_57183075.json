First, I will calculate the future value of the target amount after adjusting for 5.5% annual inflation. Next, I will determine the required monthly SIP using the provided formula and a 12% annual return rate (corresponding to 'high' risk). Then, I will create the asset allocation plan (70% equity, 30% debt) and list recommended fund categories. Finally, I will generate the complete 120-month projection table using the mandatory compound interest algorithm: `balance = balance * (1 + r) + S` for each month.

Generate a detailed asset allocation plan based on the 'high' risk guideline (70% equity / 30% debt) and recommend appropriate fund categories. 5. Generate a full month-by-month projection table.
