First, I will normalize the inputs: goal type, target amount, currency, and calculate the time horizon in years and months. Second, I'll adjust the target amount for inflation using the provided 5.5% rate. Third, based on the 'moderate' risk appetite, I'll use the corresponding 10% annual return to calculate the required monthly SIP using the standard formula. Fourth, I will map the 'moderate' risk profile to a 50/50 equity/debt asset allocation and suggest relevant fund categories. Finally, and most importantly, I will generate a full month-by-month projection table for the entire 120-month period, strictly following the provided algorithm `balance = balance * (1 + r) + S` and rounding all monetary values to two decimal places.",

I will recommend dropping the 'Short Duration Funds' category due to poor data quality and reallocating its portion to the well-covered 'Corporate Bond Funds' category. This simplifies the portfolio and anchors it in higher-quality assets, which is prudent for a retirement goal."

          "final_report": {
            "summary": "The analysis confirms that the shortlisted Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Corporate Bond funds provide excellent coverage for the 50/50 equity/debt allocation strategy. However, the shortlisted Short Duration funds are inadequate due to very low Assets Under Management (AUM), posing a risk to the portfolio. A strategic adjustment is recommended: the 'Short Duration Funds' category should be dropped, and its allocation consolidated within the robust 'Corporate Bond Funds' category to maintain the desired debt exposure with higher quality assets.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The task is to perform a reconciliation between the strategic asset allocation plan defined in T001 and the tactical fund shortlist provided in T012. The goal is to ensure the shortlisted funds provide adequate and appropriate coverage for the user's 'moderate' risk profile and 10-year retirement objective.\n\n### Strategic Plan Assessment (`allocation_plan_json`)\nThe plan from T001 recommends a 50% allocation to equity and a 50% allocation to debt. This is a classic and suitable mix for a 'moderate' risk appetite with a 10-year investment horizon. It balances the need for capital appreciation to meet the inflation-adjusted retirement corpus with the need for stability.\n\n- **Equity (50%):** The recommendation to split this between 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Mid Cap Funds' is sound. Large Cap funds offer stability and exposure to established market leaders, while Mid Cap funds provide a higher potential for growth, which is necessary to outpace inflation and achieve the target corpus. This combination aligns perfectly with the moderate risk profile.\n\n- **Debt (50%):** The plan suggests a split between 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'. Corporate Bond funds offer potentially higher yields than government securities and align well with a moderate risk profile. Short Duration funds are typically included for liquidity and to reduce interest rate sensitivity. This is a standard approach to diversifying the debt portion of a portfolio.\n\n### Fund Shortlist Analysis (`fund_shortlist_json`)\nThe shortlist from T012 provides specific fund examples for each of the recommended categories. The quality of this shortlist is variable and is the central factor in this reconciliation.\n\n- **Equity Coverage (Excellent):** The shortlisted funds in both the 'Large Cap' and 'Mid Cap' categories are strong. Funds like 'ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund' (AUM ~₹71,840 Cr) and 'HDFC Mid-Cap Opportunities Fund' (AUM ~₹75,382 Cr) are market leaders. Their substantial AUM indicates strong investor confidence, liquidity, and operational stability. Therefore, the shortlist provides excellent, high-quality coverage for the 50% equity allocation.\n\n- **Debt Coverage (Partial & Problematic):** The debt fund shortlist presents a mixed picture.\n  - **Corporate Bond Funds (Excellent):** The coverage here is strong. Funds like 'HDFC Corporate Bond Fund' (AUM ~₹38,920 Cr) are robust, well-established options that fit the investment mandate perfectly.\n  - **Short Duration Funds (Inadequate):** This is the critical point of failure. The shortlisted funds, 'Bank of India Short Term Income Fund' (AUM ~₹271 Cr) and 'Sundaram Short Duration Fund' (AUM ~₹204 Cr), have very low AUM. For a significant retirement portfolio, relying on such small funds introduces unnecessary risks, including lower liquidity and potential instability, especially during volatile market conditions. The quality assessment in T012 correctly identifies this as a major limitation.\n\n### Reconciliation and Final Recommendation\nA direct mapping of the plan to the shortlist is not advisable due to the poor quality of the Short Duration fund options. A moderate-risk retirement plan should prioritize stability and reliability in its debt component.\n\nTherefore, a strategic adjustment is required. Given the lack of high-quality, large-AUM funds in the 'Short Duration Funds' category from the provided data, it is prudent to eliminate this category from the final recommendation. The 50% debt allocation can be more safely and effectively achieved by consolidating it within the 'Corporate Bond Funds' category, for which a strong and reliable shortlist already exists.\n\nThis adjustment has two primary benefits:\n1.  **Reduces Risk:** It removes the portfolio's exposure to small, potentially illiquid funds.\n2.  **Simplifies the Portfolio:** It reduces the number of categories to manage without compromising the core 50/50 equity/debt split.\n\nThe final reconciled recommendation is to proceed with a portfolio built from three core categories: Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Corporate Bond funds. This structure fully aligns with the user's moderate risk profile, provides adequate coverage through high-quality fund options, and maintains the strategic asset allocation goals.",

The `final_category_recommendations_json` is present, non-empty, and its adjustments (dropping 'Short Duration Funds') are logically derived from the analysis within T013, showing consistency. Fourth, I will check for the presence of source data for the 11 mandatory report sections as per the addendum. I can confirm data for sections 1-7 and 9-11 is available in T001 and T013. However, a dedicated 'Risk Factors and Uncertainties' section with a minimum of 150 words (Section 8) is conspicuously missing.

The projected <b>10% annual return is not guaranteed</b> and is subject to market performance. Equity markets can be volatile, and a significant downturn, especially closer to the 10-year horizon, could impact the final corpus. The <b>assumed inflation rate of 5.5%</b> is also a projection; should actual inflation run higher, the real purchasing power of the final amount could be diminished, potentially requiring an increase in SIP contributions. Furthermore, the debt portion of the portfolio, while safer than equity, is subject to <b>interest rate risk</b>; a rising interest rate environment can negatively affect the Net Asset Value (NAV) of bond funds. Fund manager performance and changes in investment mandates are additional variables that require periodic review. This plan should be considered a roadmap, not a certainty, and must be reviewed annually to adjust for changes in market conditions, personal financial situation, and progress towards the goal.</p></section><section id='sip-charts'><h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2><div class='charts-grid'><div class='chart-container'><h3>SIP Growth Projection (Complete Timeline)</h3><canvas

After adjusting for a projected annual inflation rate of <b>5.5%</b>, the target corpus required in 10 years is approximately <b>₹5,12,44,334</b>. To meet this future value, a monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of <b>₹2,50,161</b> is calculated, based on an expected annual return of <b>10%</b> consistent with a 'Moderate' risk profile. The recommended asset allocation is a balanced <b>50% in Equity</b> and <b>50% in Debt</b>. A key strategic adjustment is to consolidate the debt portion into <b>Corporate Bond Funds</b>, dropping 'Short Duration Funds' due to unavailability of high-quality options. Following this plan, the total investment of ₹3,00,19,291 over 120 months is projected to grow to a final corpus of approximately <b>₹5,11,56,762</b>.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"goal-inputs\">\n      <h2>📋 Goal Inputs</h2>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Goal Type</td><td>Retirement</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Target Amount (Current Value)</td><td>₹3,00,00,000</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Time Horizon</td><td>10 Years</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Total Investment Period</td><td>120 Months</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Risk Appetite</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Assumed Annual Return</td><td>10.0%</td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"inflation-adjustment\">\n      <h2>🎈 Inflation Adjustment</h2>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Assumed Annual Inflation</td><td>5.5%</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Unadjusted Target Corpus</td><td>₹3,00,00,000</td></tr>\n          <tr><td><b>Inflation-Adjusted Target Corpus</b></td><td><b>₹5,12,44,333.72</b></td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"sip-calculation\">\n      <h2>🧮 SIP Calculation</h2>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Future Value (Inflation-Adjusted Target)</td><td>₹5,12,44,333.72</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Number of Months (n)</td><td>120</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Expected Monthly Return (r)</td><td>0.833%</td></tr>\n          <tr><td><b>Required Monthly SIP</b></td><td><b>₹2,50,160.76</b></td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"asset-allocation-plan\">\n      <h2>⚖️ Asset Allocation Plan</h2>\n      <p>Based on a 'Moderate' risk profile and analysis of available fund categories, the following adjusted allocation is recommended to balance growth and stability.</p>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Asset Class</th><th>Allocation %</th><th>Recommended Fund Categories</th><th>Rationale</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Equity</td><td>50%</td><td>Large Cap Funds, Mid Cap Funds</td><td>Provides a blend of stability from established companies and higher growth potential from mid-sized firms.</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Debt</td><td>50%</td><td>Corporate Bond Funds</td><td>Offers a stable anchor to the portfolio with potentially higher yields than government securities.

The projected <b>10% annual return is not guaranteed</b> and is subject to market performance. Equity markets can be volatile, and a significant downturn, especially closer to the 10-year horizon, could impact the final corpus. The <b>assumed inflation rate of 5.5%</b> is also a projection; should actual inflation run higher, the real purchasing power of the final amount could be diminished, potentially requiring an increase in SIP contributions. Furthermore, the debt portion of the portfolio, while safer than equity, is subject to <b>interest rate risk</b>; a rising interest rate environment can negatively affect the Net Asset Value (NAV) of bond funds. Fund manager performance and changes in investment mandates are additional variables that require periodic review. This plan should be considered a roadmap, not a certainty, and must be reviewed annually to adjust for changes in market conditions, personal financial situation, and progress towards the goal.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- FIXED v11 CHART SECTION - VERTICAL STACK -->\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n      <h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2>\n      <div style=\"display: block;\">\n        <!-- Asset Allocation FIRST (TOP) -->\n        <div class=\"chart-container\" style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;

            "summary": "The analysis confirms that the shortlisted Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Corporate Bond funds provide excellent coverage for the 50/50 equity/debt allocation strategy. However, the shortlisted Short Duration funds are inadequate due to very low Assets Under Management (AUM), posing a risk to the portfolio. A strategic adjustment is recommended: the 'Short Duration Funds' category should be dropped, and its allocation consolidated within the robust 'Corporate Bond Funds' category to maintain the desired debt exposure with higher quality assets.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The task is to perform a reconciliation between the strategic asset allocation plan defined in T001 and the tactical fund shortlist provided in T012. The goal is to ensure the shortlisted funds provide adequate and appropriate coverage for the user's 'moderate' risk profile and 10-year retirement objective.\n\n### Strategic Plan Assessment (`allocation_plan_json`)\nThe plan from T001 recommends a 50% allocation to equity and a 50% allocation to debt. This is a classic and suitable mix for a 'moderate' risk appetite with a 10-year investment horizon. It balances the need for capital appreciation to meet the inflation-adjusted retirement corpus with the need for stability.\n\n- **Equity (50%):** The recommendation to split this between 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Mid Cap Funds' is sound. Large Cap funds offer stability and exposure to established market leaders, while Mid Cap funds provide a higher potential for growth, which is necessary to outpace inflation and achieve the target corpus. This combination aligns perfectly with the moderate risk profile.\n\n- **Debt (50%):** The plan suggests a split between 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'. Corporate Bond funds offer potentially higher yields than government securities and align well with a moderate risk profile. Short Duration funds are typically included for liquidity and to reduce interest rate sensitivity. This is a standard approach to diversifying the debt portion of a portfolio.\n\n### Fund Shortlist Analysis (`fund_shortlist_json`)\nThe shortlist from T012 provides specific fund examples for each of the recommended categories. The quality of this shortlist is variable and is the central factor in this reconciliation.\n\n- **Equity Coverage (Excellent):** The shortlisted funds in both the 'Large Cap' and 'Mid Cap' categories are strong. Funds like 'ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund' (AUM ~₹71,840 Cr) and 'HDFC Mid-Cap Opportunities Fund' (AUM ~₹75,382 Cr) are market leaders. Their substantial AUM indicates strong investor confidence, liquidity, and operational stability. Therefore, the shortlist provides excellent, high-quality coverage for the 50% equity allocation.\n\n- **Debt Coverage (Partial & Problematic):** The debt fund shortlist presents a mixed picture.\n  - **Corporate Bond Funds (Excellent):** The coverage here is strong. Funds like 'HDFC Corporate Bond Fund' (AUM ~₹38,920 Cr) are robust, well-established options that fit the investment mandate perfectly.\n  - **Short Duration Funds (Inadequate):** This is the critical point of failure. The shortlisted funds, 'Bank of India Short Term Income Fund' (AUM ~₹271 Cr) and 'Sundaram Short Duration Fund' (AUM ~₹204 Cr), have very low AUM. For a significant retirement portfolio, relying on such small funds introduces unnecessary risks, including lower liquidity and potential instability, especially during volatile market conditions. The quality assessment in T012 correctly identifies this as a major limitation.\n\n### Reconciliation and Final Recommendation\nA direct mapping of the plan to the shortlist is not advisable due to the poor quality of the Short Duration fund options. A moderate-risk retirement plan should prioritize stability and reliability in its debt component.\n\nTherefore, a strategic adjustment is required. Given the lack of high-quality, large-AUM funds in the 'Short Duration Funds' category from the provided data, it is prudent to eliminate this category from the final recommendation. The 50% debt allocation can be more safely and effectively achieved by consolidating it within the 'Corporate Bond Funds' category, for which a strong and reliable shortlist already exists.\n\nThis adjustment has two primary benefits:\n1.  **Reduces Risk:** It removes the portfolio's exposure to small, potentially illiquid funds.\n2.  **Simplifies the Portfolio:** It reduces the number of categories to manage without compromising the core 50/50 equity/debt split.\n\nThe final reconciled recommendation is to proceed with a portfolio built from three core categories: Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Corporate Bond funds. This structure fully aligns with the user's moderate risk profile, provides adequate coverage through high-quality fund options, and maintains the strategic asset allocation goals.",

After adjusting for a projected annual inflation rate of <b>5.5%</b>, the target corpus required in 10 years is approximately <b>₹5,12,44,334</b>.

Equity markets can be volatile, and a significant downturn, especially closer to the 10-year horizon, could impact the final corpus. The <b>assumed inflation rate of 5.5%</b> is also a projection; should actual inflation run higher, the real purchasing power of the final amount could be diminished, potentially requiring an increase in SIP contributions. Furthermore, the debt portion of the portfolio, while safer than equity, is subject to <b>interest rate risk</b>; a rising interest rate environment can negatively affect the Net Asset Value (NAV) of bond funds. Fund manager performance and changes in investment mandates are additional variables that require periodic review. This plan should be considered a roadmap, not a certainty, and must be reviewed annually to adjust for changes in market conditions, personal financial situation, and progress towards the goal.</p></section><section id='sip-charts'><h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2><div class='charts-grid'><div class='chart-container'><h3>SIP Growth Projection (Complete Timeline)</h3><canvas

After adjusting for a projected annual inflation rate of <b>5.5%</b>, the target corpus required in 10 years is approximately <b>₹5,12,44,334</b>. To meet this future value, a monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of <b>₹2,50,161</b> is calculated, based on an expected annual return of <b>10%</b> consistent with a 'Moderate' risk profile. The recommended asset allocation is a balanced <b>50% in Equity</b> and <b>50% in Debt</b>. A key strategic adjustment is to consolidate the debt portion into <b>Corporate Bond Funds</b>, dropping 'Short Duration Funds' due to unavailability of high-quality options. Following this plan, the total investment of ₹3,00,19,291 over 120 months is projected to grow to a final corpus of approximately <b>₹5,11,56,762</b>.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"goal-inputs\">\n      <h2>📋 Goal Inputs</h2>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Goal Type</td><td>Retirement</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Target Amount (Current Value)</td><td>₹3,00,00,000</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Time Horizon</td><td>10 Years</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Total Investment Period</td><td>120 Months</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Risk Appetite</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Assumed Annual Return</td><td>10.0%</td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"inflation-adjustment\">\n      <h2>🎈 Inflation Adjustment</h2>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Assumed Annual Inflation</td><td>5.5%</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Unadjusted Target Corpus</td><td>₹3,00,00,000</td></tr>\n          <tr><td><b>Inflation-Adjusted Target Corpus</b></td><td><b>₹5,12,44,333.72</b></td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"sip-calculation\">\n      <h2>🧮 SIP Calculation</h2>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Future Value (Inflation-Adjusted Target)</td><td>₹5,12,44,333.72</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Number of Months (n)</td><td>120</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Expected Monthly Return (r)</td><td>0.833%</td></tr>\n          <tr><td><b>Required Monthly SIP</b></td><td><b>₹2,50,160.76</b></td></tr>\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"asset-allocation-plan\">\n      <h2>⚖️ Asset Allocation Plan</h2>\n      <p>Based on a 'Moderate' risk profile and analysis of available fund categories, the following adjusted allocation is recommended to balance growth and stability.</p>\n      <table>\n        <thead><tr><th>Asset Class</th><th>Allocation %</th><th>Recommended Fund Categories</th><th>Rationale</th></tr></thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr><td>Equity</td><td>50%</td><td>Large Cap Funds, Mid Cap Funds</td><td>Provides a blend of stability from established companies and higher growth potential from mid-sized firms.</td></tr>\n          <tr><td>Debt</td><td>50%</td><td>Corporate Bond Funds</td><td>Offers a stable anchor to the portfolio with potentially higher yields than government securities.

The projected <b>10% annual return is not guaranteed</b> and is subject to market performance. Equity markets can be volatile, and a significant downturn, especially closer to the 10-year horizon, could impact the final corpus. The <b>assumed inflation rate of 5.5%</b> is also a projection; should actual inflation run higher, the real purchasing power of the final amount could be diminished, potentially requiring an increase in SIP contributions. Furthermore, the debt portion of the portfolio, while safer than equity, is subject to <b>interest rate risk</b>; a rising interest rate environment can negatively affect the Net Asset Value (NAV) of bond funds. Fund manager performance and changes in investment mandates are additional variables that require periodic review. This plan should be considered a roadmap, not a certainty, and must be reviewed annually to adjust for changes in market conditions, personal financial situation, and progress towards the goal.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- FIXED v11 CHART SECTION - VERTICAL STACK -->\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n      <h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2>\n      <div style=\"display: block;\">\n        <!-- Asset Allocation FIRST (TOP) -->\n        <div class=\"chart-container\" style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;
