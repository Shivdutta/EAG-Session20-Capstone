            "summary": "The fund shortlist from T012 partially fulfills the strategic allocation plan from T001. While excellent options were found for 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Corporate Bond Funds', critical gaps exist for 'Mid Cap Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds' due to data retrieval failures. The investment plan cannot be fully executed without sourcing funds for these missing categories.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The objective of this task is to perform a reconciliation between the strategic asset allocation defined in T001's `allocation_plan_json` and the tactical fund options provided in T012's `fund_shortlist.json`. This analysis validates whether the shortlisted funds can adequately support the investment strategy designed for a user with a 'moderate' risk profile and a 10-year retirement goal.\n\n### Strategic Plan Analysis (from T001)\nThe `allocation_plan_json` establishes a balanced investment strategy consistent with a 'moderate' risk appetite:\n- **Asset Allocation**: 50% Equity / 50% Debt.\n- **Recommended Equity Categories**: A blend of stability and growth through 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Mid Cap Funds'.\n- **Recommended Debt Categories**: A mix of yield and safety through 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'.\nThis strategy is sound, aiming to capture market growth via equities while providing a stability cushion through debt instruments. The inclusion of Mid Cap funds is crucial for potentially higher returns needed to beat inflation over the 10-year horizon, while Short Duration funds offer liquidity and lower interest-rate sensitivity compared to longer-term bonds.\n\n### Fund Shortlist Analysis (from T012)\nThe `fund_shortlist.json` provides the results of a data retrieval and distillation process. The quality of this output is mixed:\n- **Successes**: The process successfully identified five strong candidates each for the 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Corporate Bond Funds' categories. These funds exhibit high AUM, consistent performance, and reputable fund management, making them suitable choices for the core of the portfolio.\n- **Failures**: The process failed to identify any funds for two critical categories. As explicitly stated in the `quality_assessment` section of T012's output, a search error prevented the retrieval of 'Mid Cap Funds', and the results for 'Short Duration Funds' were irrelevant and unusable.\n\n### Reconciliation and Gap Analysis\nWhen comparing the strategic requirements against the tactical availability, a significant gap emerges:\n- **Equity Coverage**: 50% of the recommended equity strategy ('Large Cap Funds') is covered. The other 50% ('Mid Cap Funds') is completely missing. Proceeding without mid-cap options would fundamentally alter the growth potential of the equity portion, making it more conservative than originally intended.\n- **Debt Coverage**: 50% of the recommended debt strategy ('Corporate Bond Funds') is covered. The remaining 50% ('Short Duration Funds') is also missing. This omits a key component for managing the debt portfolio's duration and liquidity profile.\n\nIn summary, only half of the prescribed fund categories have viable options. The current shortlist is insufficient to construct the diversified portfolio outlined in the initial plan.\n\n### Conclusion and Recommendation\nThe strategic plan and the fund shortlist are **partially aligned**. While the available funds for Large Cap and Corporate Bond categories are high quality and fit the plan, the absence of Mid Cap and Short Duration options represents a critical failure point. It is not advisable to proceed with portfolio construction using only the available funds, as this would result in an overly concentrated and improperly balanced portfolio that deviates from the user's risk profile and investment goals.\n\nThe recommended course of action is to follow the guidance provided in T012's `quality_assessment`: **Re-run the data retrieval and distillation step specifically for 'Mid Cap Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds' using more precise queries or alternative data sources.** Only after a complete and viable shortlist covering all four required categories is available should the final fund selection and portfolio construction proceed.",

Beyond the specific plan flaws already identified, investors should be aware of several broader uncertainties that can impact the final outcome. The expected 10% annual return is a long-term average and is not guaranteed; actual returns will fluctuate with market conditions. <b>Market Risk</b> is significant, as the 50% equity allocation will be exposed to stock market volatility, which can lead to periods of negative returns. The plan's success is highly dependent on the <b>Discipline of the Investor</b> to consistently contribute the required monthly amount for the full 120-month period without interruption, which can be challenged by life events or changing financial circumstances. Furthermore, <b>Inflation Risk</b> remains a key concern; if the actual rate of inflation over the next decade exceeds the 5.5% assumption, the real-terms purchasing power of the final ₹5.12 Cr corpus will be lower than anticipated. Finally, there is a clear <b>Implementation Risk</b>, highlighted by the failure to source funds for all necessary categories. An improperly constructed portfolio, lacking the growth potential of mid-cap stocks and the specific risk profile of short-duration bonds, will not perform as designed and introduces concentration risk.</p></section><section id=\"sip-charts\"><h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2><div class=\"charts-grid\"><div class=\"chart-container\"><h3>SIP Growth Projection (Complete

The monthly SIP amount must be recalculated and increased to a level that ensures the final projected corpus meets or slightly exceeds the ₹5.12 Cr inflation-adjusted target.</li>\n        <li class=\"mb-2\"><b>Re-run Fund Sourcing:</b> Trigger a new data retrieval process specifically to find high-quality 'Mid Cap Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'. The current gaps prevent the creation of a diversified portfolio aligned with the strategic plan.</li>\n        <li class=\"mb-2\"><b>Do Not Invest:</b> No capital should be deployed based on this preliminary plan. Investing with an incorrect SIP amount and an incomplete asset allocation would introduce significant risk of missing the financial goal.</li>\n      </ol>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"risk-factors\">\n      <h2>📉 Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2>\n      <p>All investments carry risk. Beyond the specific plan flaws already identified, investors should be aware of several broader uncertainties that can impact the final outcome. The expected 10% annual return is a long-term average and is not guaranteed; actual returns will fluctuate with market conditions. <b>Market Risk</b> is significant, as the 50% equity allocation will be exposed to stock market volatility, which can lead to periods of negative returns. The plan's success is highly dependent on the <b>Discipline of the Investor</b> to consistently contribute the required monthly amount for the full 120-month period without interruption, which can be challenged by life events or changing financial circumstances. Furthermore, <b>Inflation Risk</b> remains a key concern; if the actual rate of inflation over the next decade exceeds the 5.5% assumption, the real-terms purchasing power of the final ₹5.12 Cr corpus will be lower than anticipated. Finally, there is a clear <b>Implementation Risk</b>, highlighted by the failure to source funds for all necessary categories. An improperly constructed portfolio, lacking the growth potential of mid-cap stocks and the specific risk profile of short-duration bonds, will not perform as designed and introduces concentration risk.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- FIXED CHART LAYOUT (v11+) -->\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n      <h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2>\n      <div style=\"display: block;\">\n        <!-- Asset Allocation FIRST (TOP) -->\n        <div class=\"chart-container\" style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;

            "summary": "The fund shortlist from T012 partially fulfills the strategic allocation plan from T001. While excellent options were found for 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Corporate Bond Funds', critical gaps exist for 'Mid Cap Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds' due to data retrieval failures. The investment plan cannot be fully executed without sourcing funds for these missing categories.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The objective of this task is to perform a reconciliation between the strategic asset allocation defined in T001's `allocation_plan_json` and the tactical fund options provided in T012's `fund_shortlist.json`. This analysis validates whether the shortlisted funds can adequately support the investment strategy designed for a user with a 'moderate' risk profile and a 10-year retirement goal.\n\n### Strategic Plan Analysis (from T001)\nThe `allocation_plan_json` establishes a balanced investment strategy consistent with a 'moderate' risk appetite:\n- **Asset Allocation**: 50% Equity / 50% Debt.\n- **Recommended Equity Categories**: A blend of stability and growth through 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Mid Cap Funds'.\n- **Recommended Debt Categories**: A mix of yield and safety through 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'.\nThis strategy is sound, aiming to capture market growth via equities while providing a stability cushion through debt instruments. The inclusion of Mid Cap funds is crucial for potentially higher returns needed to beat inflation over the 10-year horizon, while Short Duration funds offer liquidity and lower interest-rate sensitivity compared to longer-term bonds.\n\n### Fund Shortlist Analysis (from T012)\nThe `fund_shortlist.json` provides the results of a data retrieval and distillation process. The quality of this output is mixed:\n- **Successes**: The process successfully identified five strong candidates each for the 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Corporate Bond Funds' categories. These funds exhibit high AUM, consistent performance, and reputable fund management, making them suitable choices for the core of the portfolio.\n- **Failures**: The process failed to identify any funds for two critical categories. As explicitly stated in the `quality_assessment` section of T012's output, a search error prevented the retrieval of 'Mid Cap Funds', and the results for 'Short Duration Funds' were irrelevant and unusable.\n\n### Reconciliation and Gap Analysis\nWhen comparing the strategic requirements against the tactical availability, a significant gap emerges:\n- **Equity Coverage**: 50% of the recommended equity strategy ('Large Cap Funds') is covered. The other 50% ('Mid Cap Funds') is completely missing. Proceeding without mid-cap options would fundamentally alter the growth potential of the equity portion, making it more conservative than originally intended.\n- **Debt Coverage**: 50% of the recommended debt strategy ('Corporate Bond Funds') is covered. The remaining 50% ('Short Duration Funds') is also missing. This omits a key component for managing the debt portfolio's duration and liquidity profile.\n\nIn summary, only half of the prescribed fund categories have viable options. The current shortlist is insufficient to construct the diversified portfolio outlined in the initial plan.\n\n### Conclusion and Recommendation\nThe strategic plan and the fund shortlist are **partially aligned**. While the available funds for Large Cap and Corporate Bond categories are high quality and fit the plan, the absence of Mid Cap and Short Duration options represents a critical failure point. It is not advisable to proceed with portfolio construction using only the available funds, as this would result in an overly concentrated and improperly balanced portfolio that deviates from the user's risk profile and investment goals.\n\nThe recommended course of action is to follow the guidance provided in T012's `quality_assessment`: **Re-run the data retrieval and distillation step specifically for 'Mid Cap Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds' using more precise queries or alternative data sources.** Only after a complete and viable shortlist covering all four required categories is available should the final fund selection and portfolio construction proceed.",

A critical aspect of this report will be to prominently feature the validation error identified in `T014` (the SIP calculation shortfall) and the fund availability gaps from `T013`. These are not just data points; they are crucial findings that must be highlighted in the Executive Summary, the SIP Calculation section, and the Key Recommendations. For the visualizations, I will meticulously follow the v8 chart embedding instructions, using the complete timeline data from `T015` for the charts and the 12-month data from `T016` for the detailed table. I will also create the mandatory 'Risk Factors and Uncertainties' section with sufficient depth, drawing upon both the inherent market risks and the specific issues found during the planning and validation stages. No images were found in the provided data, so I will include the mandatory debug section explaining the scan. The final output will be a single, minified HTML string.",

After adjusting for an assumed annual inflation of 5.5%, the future value required is approximately <b>₹5,12,44,334</b>. Based on a moderate risk profile with an expected annual return of 10%, the plan calculates a required monthly SIP of <b>₹2,50,161</b>. The recommended asset allocation is a balanced <b>50% in Equity and 50% in Debt</b>.</p><div class='callout warning'>⚠️ <b>Critical Findings & Required Actions:</b> This plan is <b>not ready for implementation</b> due to two critical issues identified during validation.<ul><li><b>1. Calculation Shortfall:</b> A mathematical inconsistency was discovered. The calculated monthly SIP of ₹2,50,161 results in a final projected corpus of ₹5,07,46,114, which is approximately <b>₹4,98,000 short</b> of the inflation-adjusted target. The monthly SIP amount must be recalculated and corrected.</li><li><b>2. Incomplete Fund Availability:</b> The process to identify suitable mutual funds failed for two of the four required categories. No options were found for 'Mid Cap Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'. Proceeding would result in a misaligned portfolio that does not match the intended strategy.</li></ul><p><b>Primary Recommendation:</b> The plan must be revised.

The following actions are mandatory before proceeding:</p><ol><li><b>Correct the SIP Calculation:</b> The highest priority is to resolve the mathematical error. The monthly SIP amount must be recalculated and increased to a level that ensures the final projected corpus meets or slightly exceeds the ₹5.12 Cr inflation-adjusted target.</li><li><b>Re-run Fund Sourcing:</b> Trigger a new data retrieval process specifically to find high-quality 'Mid Cap Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'. The current gaps prevent the creation of a diversified portfolio aligned with the strategic plan.</li><li><b>Do Not Invest:</b> No capital should be deployed based on this preliminary plan. Investing with an incorrect SIP amount and an incomplete asset allocation would introduce significant risk of missing the financial goal.</li></ol></section><section id='risk-factors'><h2>📉 Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2><p>All investments carry risk. Beyond the specific plan flaws already identified, investors should be aware of several broader uncertainties that can impact the final outcome. The expected 10% annual return is a long-term average and is not guaranteed; actual returns will fluctuate with market conditions. <b>Market Risk</b> is significant, as the 50% equity allocation will be exposed to stock market volatility, which can lead to periods of negative returns. The plan's success is highly dependent on the <b>Discipline of the Investor</b> to consistently contribute the required monthly amount for the full 120-month period without interruption, which can be challenged by life events or changing financial circumstances. Furthermore, <b>Inflation Risk</b> remains a key concern; if the actual rate of inflation over the next decade exceeds the 5.5% assumption, the real-terms purchasing power of the final ₹5.12 Cr corpus will be lower than anticipated. Finally, there is a clear <b>Implementation Risk</b>, highlighted by the failure to source funds for all necessary categories. An improperly constructed portfolio, lacking the growth potential of mid-cap stocks and the specific risk profile of short-duration bonds, will not perform as designed and introduces concentration risk.</p></section><section id=\"sip-charts\"><h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2><div class=\"charts-grid\"><div class=\"chart-container\"><h3>SIP Growth Projection (Complete

The monthly SIP amount must be recalculated and increased to a level that ensures the final projected corpus meets or slightly exceeds the ₹5.12 Cr inflation-adjusted target.</li>\n        <li class=\"mb-2\"><b>Re-run Fund Sourcing:</b> Trigger a new data retrieval process specifically to find high-quality 'Mid Cap Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'. The current gaps prevent the creation of a diversified portfolio aligned with the strategic plan.</li>\n        <li class=\"mb-2\"><b>Do Not Invest:</b> No capital should be deployed based on this preliminary plan. Investing with an incorrect SIP amount and an incomplete asset allocation would introduce significant risk of missing the financial goal.</li>\n      </ol>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"risk-factors\">\n      <h2>📉 Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2>\n      <p>All investments carry risk. Beyond the specific plan flaws already identified, investors should be aware of several broader uncertainties that can impact the final outcome. The expected 10% annual return is a long-term average and is not guaranteed; actual returns will fluctuate with market conditions. <b>Market Risk</b> is significant, as the 50% equity allocation will be exposed to stock market volatility, which can lead to periods of negative returns. The plan's success is highly dependent on the <b>Discipline of the Investor</b> to consistently contribute the required monthly amount for the full 120-month period without interruption, which can be challenged by life events or changing financial circumstances. Furthermore, <b>Inflation Risk</b> remains a key concern; if the actual rate of inflation over the next decade exceeds the 5.5% assumption, the real-terms purchasing power of the final ₹5.12 Cr corpus will be lower than anticipated. Finally, there is a clear <b>Implementation Risk</b>, highlighted by the failure to source funds for all necessary categories. An improperly constructed portfolio, lacking the growth potential of mid-cap stocks and the specific risk profile of short-duration bonds, will not perform as designed and introduces concentration risk.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- FIXED CHART LAYOUT (v11+) -->\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n      <h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2>\n      <div style=\"display: block;\">\n        <!-- Asset Allocation FIRST (TOP) -->\n        <div class=\"chart-container\" style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;
