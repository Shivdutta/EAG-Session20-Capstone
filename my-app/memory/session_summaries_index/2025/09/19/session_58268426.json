Normalize the inputs for goal_type 'Retirement', calculating a 10-year horizon (60-50) and 120 total months. 2. Adjust the 3 Cr target for 5.5% inflation over 10 years. 3. Based on the 'moderate' risk appetite, use a 10% annual return to calculate the required monthly SIP. 4. Map the 'moderate' risk to a 50/50 equity/debt asset allocation and list appropriate fund categories. 5. Generate the full, month-by-month projection table for all 120 months, showing compound growth based on the calculated SIP and monthly return, following the mandatory algorithm `balance = balance * (1 + r) + S`. All numerical outputs will be rounded to two decimal places.",

Pattabiraman Twitter: @pattufreefincal Published: April 12, 2022 at 6:00 am Last Updated on September 5, 2022 at 4:33 pm In an update to our previous reports, we find out how actively managed mid cap funds fared against Nifty Midcap 150 Total Returns Index (TRI) and factor-based index Nifty Midcap 150 Quality 50 TRI. From April 2022, our monthly equity mutual fund screener will include benchmarking against the Quality 50 mid cap index and NIfty 100 Low Volatility 30 index as we now have index fund options for both. See UTI Nifty Midcap 150 Quality 50 Index Fund Review and UTI S&P BSE Low Volatility Index Fund Review . The Nifty Midcap 150 Quality 50 Index has 50 stocks with higher profitability, lower leverage and more stable earnings from the Nifty Midcap 150 universe. According to the methodology document , equal weight is given to return on equity (last fiscal year), debt to equity (last fiscal year) and last five year EPS growth variability. The debt to equity factor is not used for financial services stocks. Rolling return outperformance consistency: the fund returns are compared with category benchmark returns over every possible 3Y,4Y, 5Y period. Higher the outperformance consistency, the better. Suppose 876 fund returns were compared with 876 benchmark returns, and the fund has beaten the benchmark 675 times. The consistency score will be 675/876 ~ 77%.

Active Midcap Mutual Funds vs Nifty Midcap 150 TRI Many investors believed that active midcap fund managers will be able to easily beat a market capitalization based mid cap index. Sadly, as we have established before, this is not true: Myth Busted: Active mid cap mutual fund managers can easily beat the index . As of April 7th 2022, there are 23 mid cap funds that are older than five years, Out of these, only six of them have a rolling return performance consistently of 70% or more. And one of these six is new having only about 91 5Y return data points. So it is effectively 5 out of 23 or about 22%. Which is a terrible turnout for all the high fees they charge. If we expect 70% rolling returns outperformance consistency of 70% or more over 5 years and 4 years and 3 years, we are left with only three funds! Over 5 years alone, 5 out of 23 funds qualify. Over 4 years alone, 5 out of 24 funds qualify (excluding the new fund mentioned above) Over 3 years alone, 5 out of 24 funds qualify (excluding the new fund mentioned above) This is an extraordinarily poor showing! Detailed results are available here: Equity Mutual Fund Screener April 2022: Shortlist consistent performers . Active Midcap Mutual Funds vs Nifty Midcap 150 Quality 50 TRI We have already shown that the quality index has outperformed the Midcap 150 index with reasonable consistency. So things are only going to get worse. Over 5 years alone, 1 out of 23 funds qualify and that is young! So effectively none. Over 4 years alone, 2 out of 24 funds qualify and both of them are young (one more than the other) Over 3', 'images': [{'url': 'https://freefincal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listen-to-the-Lets-Get-Rich-with-Pattu-Podcast.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Listen to the Lets Get Rich with Pattu Podcast', 'title': 'Listen to the Lets Get Rich with Pattu Podcast', 'width': '784', 'height': '267', 'class': 'wp-image-141907 size-full', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://freefincal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lets-Get-RICH-With-PATTU-podcast-on-YouTube-644x362.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Lets Get RICH With PATTU podcast on YouTube', 'title': 'Lets Get RICH With PATTU podcast on YouTube', 'width': '644', 'height': '362', 'class': 'wp-image-145294 size-large', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://freefincal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Article-bottom-Chinchu-gets-a-superpower-front-cover-for-girls-and-boys.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Both boy and girl version covers of Chinchu gets a superpower', 'width': '644', 'height': '304', 'class': 'wp-image-54855 size-full', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://freefincal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/For-bottom-Feedback-from-a-young-reader-after-reading-Chinchu-gets-a-superpower.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Feedback from a young reader after reading Chinchu gets a Superpower (small version)', 'width': '644', 'height': '208', 'class': 'wp-image-54857 size-full', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://freefincal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Travel-Training-Kit-Cover-new.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Travel-Training-Kit-Cover-new', 'width': '262', 'height': '337', 'class': 'aligncenter wp-image-31729 size-full', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/personal-finance/mutual-funds-march-2025-returns-39-pc-outperform-benchmark-list-top-performers-19595498.htm', 'content': '39% of equity mutual funds outperform benchmarks in March: A look at the performance by category - CNBC TV18 Join Us Log in / Sign up Become a Member Language English Latest news Live Updates Markets Business Personal Finance Economy India World Upcoming Events Engage with CNBC-TV18 Photos Videos Minis Web Stories Polls Quiz Healthcare Politics Travel Education & Careers Sports Views Auto Entertainment Technology Startups Lifestyle Retail Real Estate Minis Special Coverage India Business Leader Awards Branded Content HealthX Elevate India Retirement Insights Summit The Growth Summit Ceo awards Accelerate Your Cloud Journey Accelerating to a Connected Future Financial Services Cloud Symposium Crypto Education Next Ey Entrepreneur Of The Year IRMA Wizards of finance The Thought League Discover CNBCTV18 About Contact Advertise Disclaimer Terms of Use Privacy Policy Shows Anchors Polls 11:11 Newsletter Life Advertise with us Watch Live TV Market Personal Finance Business Economy LIVE TV New GST 2.0 New Global Leadership Summit Latest News New #HealthXElevate #NavigateWithHSBC #NiveshKaSahiKadam Home Latest News Featured Live TV CNBC-TV18 CNBC Awaaz CNBC Bajar Market Live Minis Podcasts CNBC-TV18 Specials HealthX Elevate Global Leadership Summit Young Turks Future Female Forward 11:11 Newsletter Nivesh Ka Sahi Kadam Photos Sections Market Global Markets Stocks Money Companies Economy Technology Cryptocurrency Terms and Conditions Disclaimer Terms of Use Privacy Policy Home Personal Finance News 39% of equity mutual funds outperform benchmarks in March: A look at the performance by category 39% of equity mutual funds outperform benchmarks in March: A look at the performance by category Large Cap Funds led the performance, with 71.88% of schemes outpacing the NIFTY 50 TRI benchmark.

Normalize the inputs for goal_type 'Retirement', calculating a 10-year horizon (60-50) and 120 total months. 2. Adjust the 3 Cr target for 5.5% inflation over 10 years. 3. Based on the 'moderate' risk appetite, use a 10% annual return to calculate the required monthly SIP. 4. Map the 'moderate' risk to a 50/50 equity/debt asset allocation and list appropriate fund categories. 5. Generate the full, month-by-month projection table for all 120 months, showing compound growth based on the calculated SIP and monthly return, following the mandatory algorithm `balance = balance * (1 + r) + S`. All numerical outputs will be rounded to two decimal places.",

Pattabiraman Twitter: @pattufreefincal Published: April 12, 2022 at 6:00 am Last Updated on September 5, 2022 at 4:33 pm In an update to our previous reports, we find out how actively managed mid cap funds fared against Nifty Midcap 150 Total Returns Index (TRI) and factor-based index Nifty Midcap 150 Quality 50 TRI. From April 2022, our monthly equity mutual fund screener will include benchmarking against the Quality 50 mid cap index and NIfty 100 Low Volatility 30 index as we now have index fund options for both. See UTI Nifty Midcap 150 Quality 50 Index Fund Review and UTI S&P BSE Low Volatility Index Fund Review . The Nifty Midcap 150 Quality 50 Index has 50 stocks with higher profitability, lower leverage and more stable earnings from the Nifty Midcap 150 universe. According to the methodology document , equal weight is given to return on equity (last fiscal year), debt to equity (last fiscal year) and last five year EPS growth variability. The debt to equity factor is not used for financial services stocks. Rolling return outperformance consistency: the fund returns are compared with category benchmark returns over every possible 3Y,4Y, 5Y period. Higher the outperformance consistency, the better. Suppose 876 fund returns were compared with 876 benchmark returns, and the fund has beaten the benchmark 675 times. The consistency score will be 675/876 ~ 77%.

Active Midcap Mutual Funds vs Nifty Midcap 150 TRI Many investors believed that active midcap fund managers will be able to easily beat a market capitalization based mid cap index. Sadly, as we have established before, this is not true: Myth Busted: Active mid cap mutual fund managers can easily beat the index . As of April 7th 2022, there are 23 mid cap funds that are older than five years, Out of these, only six of them have a rolling return performance consistently of 70% or more. And one of these six is new having only about 91 5Y return data points. So it is effectively 5 out of 23 or about 22%. Which is a terrible turnout for all the high fees they charge. If we expect 70% rolling returns outperformance consistency of 70% or more over 5 years and 4 years and 3 years, we are left with only three funds! Over 5 years alone, 5 out of 23 funds qualify. Over 4 years alone, 5 out of 24 funds qualify (excluding the new fund mentioned above) Over 3 years alone, 5 out of 24 funds qualify (excluding the new fund mentioned above) This is an extraordinarily poor showing! Detailed results are available here: Equity Mutual Fund Screener April 2022: Shortlist consistent performers . Active Midcap Mutual Funds vs Nifty Midcap 150 Quality 50 TRI We have already shown that the quality index has outperformed the Midcap 150 index with reasonable consistency. So things are only going to get worse. Over 5 years alone, 1 out of 23 funds qualify and that is young! So effectively none. Over 4 years alone, 2 out of 24 funds qualify and both of them are young (one more than the other) Over 3', 'images': [{'url': 'https://freefincal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Listen-to-the-Lets-Get-Rich-with-Pattu-Podcast.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Listen to the Lets Get Rich with Pattu Podcast', 'title': 'Listen to the Lets Get Rich with Pattu Podcast', 'width': '784', 'height': '267', 'class': 'wp-image-141907 size-full', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://freefincal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lets-Get-RICH-With-PATTU-podcast-on-YouTube-644x362.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Lets Get RICH With PATTU podcast on YouTube', 'title': 'Lets Get RICH With PATTU podcast on YouTube', 'width': '644', 'height': '362', 'class': 'wp-image-145294 size-large', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://freefincal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Article-bottom-Chinchu-gets-a-superpower-front-cover-for-girls-and-boys.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Both boy and girl version covers of Chinchu gets a superpower', 'width': '644', 'height': '304', 'class': 'wp-image-54855 size-full', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://freefincal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/For-bottom-Feedback-from-a-young-reader-after-reading-Chinchu-gets-a-superpower.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Feedback from a young reader after reading Chinchu gets a Superpower (small version)', 'width': '644', 'height': '208', 'class': 'wp-image-54857 size-full', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}, {'url': 'https://freefincal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Travel-Training-Kit-Cover-new.jpg', 'alt_text': 'Travel-Training-Kit-Cover-new', 'width': '262', 'height': '337', 'class': 'aligncenter wp-image-31729 size-full', 'confidence': 0.8999999999999999}], 'rank': 4}, {'url': 'https://www.cnbctv18.com/personal-finance/mutual-funds-march-2025-returns-39-pc-outperform-benchmark-list-top-performers-19595498.htm', 'content': '39% of equity mutual funds outperform benchmarks in March: A look at the performance by category - CNBC TV18 Join Us Log in / Sign up Become a Member Language English Latest news Live Updates Markets Business Personal Finance Economy India World Upcoming Events Engage with CNBC-TV18 Photos Videos Minis Web Stories Polls Quiz Healthcare Politics Travel Education & Careers Sports Views Auto Entertainment Technology Startups Lifestyle Retail Real Estate Minis Special Coverage India Business Leader Awards Branded Content HealthX Elevate India Retirement Insights Summit The Growth Summit Ceo awards Accelerate Your Cloud Journey Accelerating to a Connected Future Financial Services Cloud Symposium Crypto Education Next Ey Entrepreneur Of The Year IRMA Wizards of finance The Thought League Discover CNBCTV18 About Contact Advertise Disclaimer Terms of Use Privacy Policy Shows Anchors Polls 11:11 Newsletter Life Advertise with us Watch Live TV Market Personal Finance Business Economy LIVE TV New GST 2.0 New Global Leadership Summit Latest News New #HealthXElevate #NavigateWithHSBC #NiveshKaSahiKadam Home Latest News Featured Live TV CNBC-TV18 CNBC Awaaz CNBC Bajar Market Live Minis Podcasts CNBC-TV18 Specials HealthX Elevate Global Leadership Summit Young Turks Future Female Forward 11:11 Newsletter Nivesh Ka Sahi Kadam Photos Sections Market Global Markets Stocks Money Companies Economy Technology Cryptocurrency Terms and Conditions Disclaimer Terms of Use Privacy Policy Home Personal Finance News 39% of equity mutual funds outperform benchmarks in March: A look at the performance by category 39% of equity mutual funds outperform benchmarks in March: A look at the performance by category Large Cap Funds led the performance, with 71.88% of schemes outpacing the NIFTY 50 TRI benchmark.

This directly addresses the user's prompt.",
            "what_was_missed": "Let me think through this: I should not just analyze each fund category in isolation. The synergy of the portfolio is key. For example, the higher volatility of Mid Cap funds is intentionally balanced by the stability of Large Cap funds and the entire debt portion. I need to articulate this portfolio construction logic clearly.",

I must clarify that its role is not as a standalone 10-year instrument, but as a component to reduce the overall interest rate sensitivity (duration risk) of the debt portion of the long-term portfolio.",
