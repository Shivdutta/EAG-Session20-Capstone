Next, I'll adjust the target amount of 3 crore INR for 5.5% inflation over 10 years. Then, using the 'moderate' risk profile's 10% annual return, I'll calculate the required monthly SIP to reach the inflation-adjusted future value. After that, I'll define the 50/50 equity/debt asset allocation for a moderate profile and list appropriate fund categories. Finally, I will generate the full 120-month projection table by iteratively applying the compound interest formula, showing the growth of the corpus month by month. All numerical outputs will be rounded to two decimal places.",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: This report details the reconciliation between the strategic investment plan and a tactical shortlist of mutual funds. The primary objective is to verify that the funds identified in step T012 are consistent with the asset allocation and fund category recommendations established in step T001.\n\n**Strategic Plan (from T001):**\nThe initial `allocation_plan_json` defined a balanced portfolio for a user with a 'moderate' risk appetite. The core parameters of this plan were:\n- **Asset Split:** 50% Equity, 50% Debt.\n- **Equity Categories:** 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Mid Cap Funds'.\n- **Debt Categories:** 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'.\nThis plan serves as the ground truth for the desired portfolio structure.\n\n**Tactical Shortlist (from T012):**\nThe `fund_shortlist.json` provided a list of ten specific mutual funds, which were distilled from a broader search. These funds were pre-categorized during the distillation process.\n\n**Reconciliation Analysis:**\nA direct comparison was conducted between the categories required by the plan and the categories represented in the shortlist. The results show a perfect match:\n- **Large Cap Funds:** The plan required this category, and the shortlist provided three examples (PGIM India Large Cap, Nippon India Large Cap, ICICI Prudential Bluechip).\n- **Mid Cap Funds:** The plan required this category, and the shortlist provided two examples (Motilal Oswal Midcap, Invesco India Mid Cap).\n- **Corporate Bond Funds:** The plan required this category, and the shortlist provided three examples (Nippon India Corporate Bond, HDFC Corporate Bond, ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond).\n- **Short Duration Funds:** The plan required this category, and the shortlist provided two examples (Bank of India Short Term Income, Sundaram Short Duration).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe alignment is flawless. There are no funds in the shortlist from categories not specified in the plan, nor are there any categories from the plan that are missing from the shortlist. This successful reconciliation validates that the fund discovery and distillation steps were executed in precise alignment with the initial strategy. The output, `reconciled_fund_plan.json`, formalizes this mapping and can be used with high confidence in subsequent stages of portfolio analysis and construction.",

Spread investments across 2-3 different funds within each recommended category (e.g., Large Cap, Corporate Bond) to reduce fund-specific risk.</li><li><b>Annual Portfolio Review:</b> Review your portfolio at least once a year.

Rebalance the portfolio back to the target 50/50 allocation during this review.</li><li><b>Perform Due Diligence:</b> The funds listed are examples for category alignment only and do not constitute an investment recommendation.

The projections are based on assumptions that may not hold true in the future. <b>Market Risk</b> is the most significant factor; equity markets are volatile and can experience downturns, causing the value of your investments to fall. The assumed 10% annual return is a long-term average, not a guaranteed year-on-year figure. Secondly, <b>Inflation Risk</b> poses a threat; if the actual rate of inflation is higher than the projected 5.5%, the purchasing power of your final corpus will be lower than anticipated. For the debt portion of your portfolio, <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> is relevant, as rising interest rates can negatively impact the value of existing bonds.

Factoring in an annual inflation rate of <b>5.5%</b>, the future target corpus required is approximately <b>₹5.12 Crore</b>. To reach this goal with an assumed annual return of 10% based on a 'moderate' risk profile, a monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of <b>₹2,50,161.46</b> is necessary. The recommended strategy involves a balanced portfolio with a <b>50/50 allocation</b> between equity and debt instruments.

Automating this investment is the most effective way to ensure discipline.</li>\n        <li><b>Adhere to Allocation:</b> Stick to the 50/50 equity-debt allocation. This balance is key to managing risk in line with your moderate profile.</li>\n        <li><b>Diversify Within Categories:</b> Spread investments across 2-3 different funds within each recommended category (e.g., Large Cap, Corporate Bond) to reduce fund-specific risk.</li>\n        <li><b>Annual Portfolio Review:</b> Review your portfolio at least once a year. Market movements may cause your allocation to drift. Rebalance the portfolio back to the target 50/50 allocation during this review.</li>\n      </ol>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"risk-factors\">\n      <h2>⚖️ Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2>\n      <p>All investments are subject to risk, and it is crucial to understand the uncertainties inherent in this financial plan. The projections are based on assumptions that may not hold true in the future. <b>Market Risk</b> is the most significant factor; equity markets are volatile and can experience downturns, causing the value of your investments to fall. The assumed 10% annual return is a long-term average, not a guaranteed year-on-year figure. Secondly, <b>Inflation Risk</b> poses a threat; if the actual rate of inflation is higher than the projected 5.5%, the purchasing power of your final corpus will be lower than anticipated. For the debt portion of your portfolio, <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> is relevant, as rising interest rates can negatively impact the value of existing bonds. Furthermore, this plan carries <b>Model Risk</b>—it is a mathematical projection, not a guarantee of future results. Unforeseen life events, regulatory changes, or economic shifts can all impact your ability to invest and the returns generated. You should regularly review this plan and adjust it as your circumstances and market conditions change.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- v15 FIXED CHART LAYOUT - VERTICAL STACK -->\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n      <h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2>\n      <div style=\"display: block;

The primary objective is to verify that the funds identified in step T012 are consistent with the asset allocation and fund category recommendations established in step T001.\n\n**Strategic Plan (from T001):**\nThe initial `allocation_plan_json` defined a balanced portfolio for a user with a 'moderate' risk appetite. The core parameters of this plan were:\n- **Asset Split:** 50% Equity, 50% Debt.\n- **Equity Categories:** 'Large Cap Funds' and 'Mid Cap Funds'.\n- **Debt Categories:** 'Corporate Bond Funds' and 'Short Duration Funds'.\nThis plan serves as the ground truth for the desired portfolio structure.\n\n**Tactical Shortlist (from T012):**\nThe `fund_shortlist.json` provided a list of ten specific mutual funds, which were distilled from a broader search. These funds were pre-categorized during the distillation process.\n\n**Reconciliation Analysis:**\nA direct comparison was conducted between the categories required by the plan and the categories represented in the shortlist. The results show a perfect match:\n- **Large Cap Funds:** The plan required this category, and the shortlist provided three examples (PGIM India Large Cap, Nippon India Large Cap, ICICI Prudential Bluechip).\n- **Mid Cap Funds:** The plan required this category, and the shortlist provided two examples (Motilal Oswal Midcap, Invesco India Mid Cap).\n- **Corporate Bond Funds:** The plan required this category, and the shortlist provided three examples (Nippon India Corporate Bond, HDFC Corporate Bond, ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond).\n- **Short Duration Funds:** The plan required this category, and the shortlist provided two examples (Bank of India Short Term Income, Sundaram Short Duration).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe alignment is flawless. There are no funds in the shortlist from categories not specified in the plan, nor are there any categories from the plan that are missing from the shortlist. This successful reconciliation validates that the fund discovery and distillation steps were executed in precise alignment with the initial strategy. The output, `reconciled_fund_plan.json`, formalizes this mapping and can be used with high confidence in subsequent stages of portfolio analysis and construction.",

A significant discrepancy here is a critical failure.\n2.  **Allocation Verification (T001):** I will check if `equity_percent` and `debt_percent` in `allocation_plan_json` sum to 100.\n3.  **Consistency Check (T001 vs T013):** I will compare the `recommended_fund_categories` from T001 with the categories present in the `reconciled_fund_plan_json` from T013 to ensure perfect alignment.\n4.  **Report Content Verification (T001 & T013):** Based on the addendum, I will check for the presence of data that would populate the mandatory report sections.

Factoring in an annual inflation rate of <b>5.5%</b>, the future target corpus required is approximately <b>₹5.12 Crore</b>. To reach this goal with an assumed annual return of 10% based on a 'moderate' risk profile, a monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of <b>₹2,50,161.46</b> is necessary.

Automating this investment is the most effective way to ensure discipline.</li><li><b>Adhere to Allocation:</b> Stick to the 50/50 equity-debt allocation. This balance is key to managing risk in line with your moderate profile.</li><li><b>Diversify Within Categories:</b> Do not invest the entire allocation for a category into a single fund. Spread investments across 2-3 different funds within each recommended category (e.g., Large Cap, Corporate Bond) to reduce fund-specific risk.</li><li><b>Annual Portfolio Review:</b> Review your portfolio at least once a year. Market movements may cause your allocation to drift (e.g., become 60/40). Rebalance the portfolio back to the target 50/50 allocation during this review.</li><li><b>Perform Due Diligence:</b> The funds listed are examples for category alignment only and do not constitute an investment recommendation. You must conduct your own research or consult a financial advisor to select the specific funds that best suit your needs.</li></ol></section><section id='risk-factors'><h2>⚖️ Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2><p>All investments are subject to risk, and it is crucial to understand the uncertainties inherent in this financial plan. The projections are based on assumptions that may not hold true in the future. <b>Market Risk</b> is the most significant factor; equity markets are volatile and can experience downturns, causing the value of your investments to fall. The assumed 10% annual return is a long-term average, not a guaranteed year-on-year figure. Secondly, <b>Inflation Risk</b> poses a threat; if the actual rate of inflation is higher than the projected 5.5%, the purchasing power of your final corpus will be lower than anticipated. For the debt portion of your portfolio, <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> is relevant, as rising interest rates can negatively impact the value of existing bonds. Furthermore, this plan carries <b>Model Risk</b>—it is a mathematical projection, not a guarantee of future results. Unforeseen life events, regulatory changes, or economic shifts can all impact your ability to invest and the returns generated.

Factoring in an annual inflation rate of <b>5.5%</b>, the future target corpus required is approximately <b>₹5.12 Crore</b>. To reach this goal with an assumed annual return of 10% based on a 'moderate' risk profile, a monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of <b>₹2,50,161.46</b> is necessary. The recommended strategy involves a balanced portfolio with a <b>50/50 allocation</b> between equity and debt instruments.

Automating this investment is the most effective way to ensure discipline.</li>\n        <li><b>Adhere to Allocation:</b> Stick to the 50/50 equity-debt allocation. This balance is key to managing risk in line with your moderate profile.</li>\n        <li><b>Diversify Within Categories:</b> Spread investments across 2-3 different funds within each recommended category (e.g., Large Cap, Corporate Bond) to reduce fund-specific risk.</li>\n        <li><b>Annual Portfolio Review:</b> Review your portfolio at least once a year. Market movements may cause your allocation to drift. Rebalance the portfolio back to the target 50/50 allocation during this review.</li>\n      </ol>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"risk-factors\">\n      <h2>⚖️ Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2>\n      <p>All investments are subject to risk, and it is crucial to understand the uncertainties inherent in this financial plan. The projections are based on assumptions that may not hold true in the future. <b>Market Risk</b> is the most significant factor; equity markets are volatile and can experience downturns, causing the value of your investments to fall. The assumed 10% annual return is a long-term average, not a guaranteed year-on-year figure. Secondly, <b>Inflation Risk</b> poses a threat; if the actual rate of inflation is higher than the projected 5.5%, the purchasing power of your final corpus will be lower than anticipated. For the debt portion of your portfolio, <b>Interest Rate Risk</b> is relevant, as rising interest rates can negatively impact the value of existing bonds. Furthermore, this plan carries <b>Model Risk</b>—it is a mathematical projection, not a guarantee of future results. Unforeseen life events, regulatory changes, or economic shifts can all impact your ability to invest and the returns generated. You should regularly review this plan and adjust it as your circumstances and market conditions change.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- v15 FIXED CHART LAYOUT - VERTICAL STACK -->\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n      <h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2>\n      <div style=\"display: block;
