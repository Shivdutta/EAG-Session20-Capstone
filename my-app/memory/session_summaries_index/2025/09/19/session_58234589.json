I will first normalize the inputs. Then, I will adjust the target amount for inflation (5.5% over 10 years). Next, I will determine the expected annual return (11% for high_moderate) and calculate the required monthly SIP to reach the inflation-adjusted target. Based on the risk profile, I will define a 60/40 Equity/Debt asset allocation plan with recommended fund categories. Finally, and most importantly, I will generate a complete month-by-month projection table for all 120 months, showing the growth of the corpus over time.

I will scan the `content` field of each search result. I anticipate that the quality of the raw text will be variable, with some useful tables and a lot of noise. I must be careful not to fabricate data and to report when specific metrics are not found. I've identified that the `paisabazaar.com` link for corporate bonds is the most promising source as it contains a clear table of returns. For other categories, the data seems less direct, and I may have to rely more on qualitative descriptions.

The debt component's expected return of ~7% is data-supported. The reconciled plan retains the original structure while highlighting the performance dependency on equity funds.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The primary objective of this task is to reconcile a strategic asset allocation plan with empirical data distilled from web searches. The initial plan, generated in T001, proposed a 60% equity and 40% debt allocation for a retirement goal with a 10-year horizon and a 'high_moderate' risk appetite. This allocation was based on a target blended return of 11% per annum. The recommended categories were Large Cap and Mid Cap funds for equity, and Corporate Bond and Government Securities funds for debt.\n\nThe subsequent data distillation step, T012, provided qualitative and, where possible, quantitative summaries for these categories. A significant discrepancy immediately emerged: while the qualitative descriptions of each fund category aligned well with their intended roles in the portfolio (e.g., Mid Caps for growth, Corporate Bonds for stability), the quantitative data was sparse. Crucially, no concrete multi-year return figures were found for Large Cap, Mid Cap, or Gilt funds. The only hard data point was for Corporate Bond funds, showing average returns between 6.2% and 7.6% over 3-10 year periods.\n\nMy reconciliation process involved the following steps:\n\n1.  **Validating the Debt Component:** The data from T012 for Corporate Bond funds (~7% average return) provides a strong anchor. This figure is a realistic and appropriate expectation for the high-quality debt portion of a portfolio. This validation confirms that the 40% allocation to debt will likely perform its intended role of providing stability and predictable, albeit lower, returns.\n\n2.  **Quantifying the Equity Requirement:** With the debt component's expected return established at ~7%, I calculated the required return from the equity component to achieve the overall 11% target. The formula is: `(0.60 * Equity_Return) + (0.40 * 7.0%) = 11.0%`. This simplifies to `(0.60 * Equity_Return) = 11.0% - 2.8%`, which means `Equity_Return = 8.2% / 0.60`, yielding a required annual return of approximately 13.67% from the equity allocation.\n\n3.  **Addressing the Data Gap:** Since the provided context lacks performance data for Large Cap and Mid Cap funds, it's impossible to empirically verify if they can achieve this 13.7% target. The reconciliation must therefore proceed on a qualitative and theoretical basis. The descriptions in T012 support their roles: Large Caps for stable growth and Mid Caps for higher, more volatile growth. The plan's success is explicitly conditional on these funds delivering on their market expectation of higher returns over a long-term horizon.\n\n4.  **Constructing the Reconciled Plan:** The final `reconciled_plan` object was structured to make this logic transparent. For each category, it provides:\n    *   **Qualitative Rationale:** Explains *why* the category fits the strategy, drawing from the descriptions in T012.\n    *   **Quantitative Validation:** States what the data shows. For Corporate Bonds, it confirms the return expectation. For all other categories, it explicitly states that data was not available and articulates the *forward-looking performance expectation* required for the plan to work.\n    *   **Risk Profile Alignment:** Connects the category's characteristics (e.g., volatility, credit risk) back to the investor's 'high_moderate' risk appetite.\n\nIn conclusion, the reconciliation confirms that the strategic allocation is sound in structure and theory. However, it is critically dependent on the performance of its equity component, which could not be verified with the provided data. The plan is viable but carries the uncertainty associated with equity market performance, which must deliver an average of ~13.7% over the next decade to meet the investor's ambitious retirement goal.",

It is strongly recommended to use the corrected amount for actual investment.</div><div class='table-container'><table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value (Original Calculation)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Adjusted Target Corpus</td><td>₹5,12,44,328.75</td></tr><tr><td>Investment Duration (Months)</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Assumed Monthly Rate of Return</td><td>0.916667%</td></tr><tr><td><b>Calculated Monthly SIP</b></td><td><b>₹2,36,514.15</b></td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id='asset-allocation'><h2>⚖️ Reconciled Asset Allocation Plan</h2><p>The investment strategy is based on a 'high_moderate' risk profile, balancing aggressive growth potential with capital preservation. The following allocation has been reconciled with available market data and qualitative analysis.</p><h3>Overall Allocation: 60% Equity / 40% Debt</h3><blockquote>The 60/40 allocation is designed to achieve a blended portfolio return of approximately 11% annually. Success is contingent on the equity portion generating an average annual return of approximately <b>13.7%</b> to compensate for the lower, more stable returns from the debt portion (validated at ~7%).</blockquote><h3>Detailed Category Breakdown:</h3><div class='category-breakdown'><h4>Asset Class: Equity (60%)</h4><ul><li><strong>Large Cap Funds:</strong> Forms the core of the equity portfolio, providing relatively stable growth by investing in well-established companies. This aligns with the 'high_moderate' profile by providing exposure to equity growth while managing volatility.</li><li><strong>Mid Cap Funds:</strong> Acts as the primary growth driver to achieve the target corpus. These funds invest in companies with high growth potential and are essential for achieving the ambitious target, aligning with the 'high' component of the risk appetite.</li></ul><h4>Asset Class: Debt (40%)</h4><ul><li><strong>Corporate Bond Funds:</strong> Provides stability and predictable income. Investing in high-credit-quality corporate bonds offers a balance of safety and superior returns to traditional savings. Data confirms expected returns in the 6-8% range, anchoring the portfolio.</li><li><strong>Government Securities (Gilt Funds):</strong> Offers the highest level of safety with zero credit risk. This component ensures a part of the portfolio is free from default risk, further stabilizing the plan during economic uncertainty.</li></ul></div></section><section id='allocation-notes'><h2>📝 Allocation Risk Profile Notes</h2><p>The chosen 'High-Moderate' allocation fits within a spectrum of risk-based strategies. Understanding these levels provides context for the recommendation.</p><ul><li><b>Very Low:</b> Extremely conservative, e.g., 90% debt / 10% equity.</li><li><b>Low:</b> Conservative, e.g., 70% debt / 30% equity.</li><li><b>Low-Moderate:</b> Tilted conservative, e.g., 60% debt / 40% equity.</li><li><b>Moderate:</b> Balanced mix, e.g., 50% equity / 50% debt.</li><li><b>High-Moderate:</b> Tilted aggressive, e.g., 60% equity / 40% debt. <i>(Selected Profile)</i></li><li><b>High:</b> Aggressive, e.g., 70% equity / 30% debt.</li><li><b>Very High:</b> Extremely aggressive, e.g., 90% equity / 10% debt.</li></ul></section><section id='key-recommendations'><h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2><ol><li><b>Proceed with the 60/40 Equity/Debt allocation</b> as it is well-aligned with the stated 'high_moderate' risk profile and 10-year time horizon.</li><li><b>Acknowledge Performance Dependency:</b> Achieving the ~₹5.1 Cr inflation-adjusted target is highly dependent on the equity portion of the portfolio generating average annual returns of approximately <b>13.7%</b>. This is an expectation, not a guarantee.</li><li><b>Prioritize Fund Selection:</b> When selecting specific mutual funds, prioritize those with a consistent track record of outperforming their respective benchmarks over 5-10 year periods to increase the probability of meeting the required return target.</li><li><b>Commit to the Correct SIP Amount:</b> Ensure future investments use the corrected monthly SIP amount of <b>₹2,41,120</b> to avoid a potential shortfall at the end of the investment term.</li></ol></section><section id='risk-factors'><h2>📉 Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2><p>This financial plan is based on projections and assumptions which are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. It is crucial to understand these factors. <i>The primary risk is that the assumed 11% blended return is not achieved.</i> The plan's success is heavily reliant on the equity component delivering ~13.7% annually; sustained market underperformance due to economic downturns, geopolitical events, or sector-specific issues could lead to a significant corpus shortfall. Secondly, <b>inflation risk</b> is a major concern; if the actual average inflation rate exceeds the projected 5.5%, the final corpus will have less purchasing power than intended, potentially jeopardizing retirement goals. Furthermore, the debt portion of the portfolio is subject to <b>interest rate risk</b>. While Government Securities carry no credit risk, their market value can decrease if interest rates rise, potentially leading to short-term capital losses. Finally, <b>investor behavior risk</b>, such as discontinuing SIPs during market downturns or making emotional investment decisions, can severely derail the plan. Consistency and discipline are paramount to navigating the 10-year journey successfully.</p></section><section id='sip-charts'><h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2><div

It is crucial to understand these factors. <i>The primary risk is that the assumed 11% blended return is not achieved.</i> The plan's success is heavily reliant on the equity component delivering ~13.7% annually; sustained market underperformance due to economic downturns, geopolitical events, or sector-specific issues could lead to a significant corpus shortfall. Secondly, <b>inflation risk</b> is a major concern; if the actual average inflation rate exceeds the projected 5.5%, the final corpus will have less purchasing power than intended, potentially jeopardizing retirement goals. Furthermore, the debt portion of the portfolio is subject to <b>interest rate risk</b>. While Government Securities carry no credit risk, their market value can decrease if interest rates rise. Finally, <b>investor behavior risk</b>, such as discontinuing SIPs during market downturns or making emotional investment decisions, can severely derail the plan. Consistency and discipline are paramount to navigating the 10-year journey successfully.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"allocation-notes\">\n        <h2>📝 Allocation Risk Profile Notes</h2>\n        <p>The chosen 'High-Moderate' allocation fits within a spectrum of risk-based strategies.

Determine the expected annual return for 'high_moderate' risk (11%) and compute the monthly return 'r'. 4. Calculate the required monthly SIP amount to reach the adjusted target. 5. Generate an asset allocation plan (equity % vs. debt %) based on the 'high_moderate' risk profile (e.g., 60% equity / 40% debt). 6. Recommend fund categories appropriate for this allocation. 7.

The debt component's expected return of ~7% is data-supported. The reconciled plan retains the original structure while highlighting the performance dependency on equity funds.",
            "detailed": "Let me think through this: The primary objective of this task is to reconcile a strategic asset allocation plan with empirical data distilled from web searches. The initial plan, generated in T001, proposed a 60% equity and 40% debt allocation for a retirement goal with a 10-year horizon and a 'high_moderate' risk appetite. This allocation was based on a target blended return of 11% per annum. The recommended categories were Large Cap and Mid Cap funds for equity, and Corporate Bond and Government Securities funds for debt.\n\nThe subsequent data distillation step, T012, provided qualitative and, where possible, quantitative summaries for these categories. A significant discrepancy immediately emerged: while the qualitative descriptions of each fund category aligned well with their intended roles in the portfolio (e.g., Mid Caps for growth, Corporate Bonds for stability), the quantitative data was sparse. Crucially, no concrete multi-year return figures were found for Large Cap, Mid Cap, or Gilt funds. The only hard data point was for Corporate Bond funds, showing average returns between 6.2% and 7.6% over 3-10 year periods.\n\nMy reconciliation process involved the following steps:\n\n1.  **Validating the Debt Component:** The data from T012 for Corporate Bond funds (~7% average return) provides a strong anchor. This figure is a realistic and appropriate expectation for the high-quality debt portion of a portfolio. This validation confirms that the 40% allocation to debt will likely perform its intended role of providing stability and predictable, albeit lower, returns.\n\n2.  **Quantifying the Equity Requirement:** With the debt component's expected return established at ~7%, I calculated the required return from the equity component to achieve the overall 11% target. The formula is: `(0.60 * Equity_Return) + (0.40 * 7.0%) = 11.0%`. This simplifies to `(0.60 * Equity_Return) = 11.0% - 2.8%`, which means `Equity_Return = 8.2% / 0.60`, yielding a required annual return of approximately 13.67% from the equity allocation.\n\n3.  **Addressing the Data Gap:** Since the provided context lacks performance data for Large Cap and Mid Cap funds, it's impossible to empirically verify if they can achieve this 13.7% target. The reconciliation must therefore proceed on a qualitative and theoretical basis. The descriptions in T012 support their roles: Large Caps for stable growth and Mid Caps for higher, more volatile growth. The plan's success is explicitly conditional on these funds delivering on their market expectation of higher returns over a long-term horizon.\n\n4.  **Constructing the Reconciled Plan:** The final `reconciled_plan` object was structured to make this logic transparent. For each category, it provides:\n    *   **Qualitative Rationale:** Explains *why* the category fits the strategy, drawing from the descriptions in T012.\n    *   **Quantitative Validation:** States what the data shows. For Corporate Bonds, it confirms the return expectation. For all other categories, it explicitly states that data was not available and articulates the *forward-looking performance expectation* required for the plan to work.\n    *   **Risk Profile Alignment:** Connects the category's characteristics (e.g., volatility, credit risk) back to the investor's 'high_moderate' risk appetite.\n\nIn conclusion, the reconciliation confirms that the strategic allocation is sound in structure and theory. However, it is critically dependent on the performance of its equity component, which could not be verified with the provided data. The plan is viable but carries the uncertainty associated with equity market performance, which must deliver an average of ~13.7% over the next decade to meet the investor's ambitious retirement goal.",

A critical piece of information is the QA verdict from T014, which found a 'critical' mathematical error in the initial SIP calculation in T001. This is a crucial finding that I must not ignore. Instead of hiding it, a top-tier consulting report would address it head-on. Therefore, I will include a prominent warning callout in the 'SIP Calculation' section to highlight this discrepancy, explaining the issue and providing the corrected value as recommended by the QA agent. This demonstrates thoroughness and builds trust. The rest of the report will be built by methodically extracting data for each section: goal inputs, inflation, and allocation notes from T001; the detailed, nuanced asset allocation plan from the reconciled data in T013; key recommendations and risks also from T013. For the risk section, I will synthesize the points from T013 and expand upon them to meet the 150-word minimum, adding context on market, inflation, and execution risks. The chart and table sections are highly specific. I will use the exact Chart.js embedding code from the prompt, injecting the full 120-month projection data from T015 into the script tag. The 12-month summary table will be populated using the data from T016. I have scanned the entire input context for images and found none, so I will add the mandatory debug section explaining this.

After adjusting for a projected annual inflation rate of 5.5%, the target corpus required at the time of retirement is approximately <b>₹5.12 Crore</b>. Based on a 'high_moderate' risk appetite and an expected blended annual return of 11%, the analysis recommends a monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of approximately <b>₹2,41,120</b>. The investment strategy is centered around a diversified portfolio with an asset allocation of <b>60% in Equity</b> (Large Cap and Mid Cap funds) and <b>40% in Debt</b> (Corporate Bonds and Government Securities) to balance growth with stability. A critical quality assurance review (T014) identified a mathematical error in the initial SIP calculation, which suggested a lower amount.

The following allocation has been reconciled with available market data and qualitative analysis.</p><h3>Overall Allocation: 60% Equity / 40% Debt</h3><blockquote>The 60/40 allocation is designed to achieve a blended portfolio return of approximately 11% annually. Success is contingent on the equity portion generating an average annual return of approximately <b>13.7%</b> to compensate for the lower, more stable returns from the debt portion (validated at ~7%).</blockquote><h3>Detailed Category Breakdown:</h3><div class='category-breakdown'><h4>Asset Class: Equity (60%)</h4><ul><li><strong>Large Cap Funds:</strong> Forms the core of the equity portfolio, providing relatively stable growth by investing in well-established companies. This aligns with the 'high_moderate' profile by providing exposure to equity growth while managing volatility.</li><li><strong>Mid Cap Funds:</strong> Acts as the primary growth driver to achieve the target corpus. These funds invest in companies with high growth potential and are essential for achieving the ambitious target, aligning with the 'high' component of the risk appetite.</li></ul><h4>Asset Class: Debt (40%)</h4><ul><li><strong>Corporate Bond Funds:</strong> Provides stability and predictable income. Investing in high-credit-quality corporate bonds offers a balance of safety and superior returns to traditional savings. Data confirms expected returns in the 6-8% range, anchoring the portfolio.</li><li><strong>Government Securities (Gilt Funds):</strong> Offers the highest level of safety with zero credit risk. This component ensures a part of the portfolio is free from default risk, further stabilizing the plan during economic uncertainty.</li></ul></div></section><section id='allocation-notes'><h2>📝 Allocation Risk Profile Notes</h2><p>The chosen 'High-Moderate' allocation fits within a spectrum of risk-based strategies. Understanding these levels provides context for the recommendation.</p><ul><li><b>Very Low:</b> Extremely conservative, e.g., 90% debt / 10% equity.</li><li><b>Low:</b> Conservative, e.g., 70% debt / 30% equity.</li><li><b>Low-Moderate:</b> Tilted conservative, e.g., 60% debt / 40% equity.</li><li><b>Moderate:</b> Balanced mix, e.g., 50% equity / 50% debt.</li><li><b>High-Moderate:</b> Tilted aggressive, e.g., 60% equity / 40% debt. <i>(Selected Profile)</i></li><li><b>High:</b> Aggressive, e.g., 70% equity / 30% debt.</li><li><b>Very High:</b> Extremely aggressive, e.g., 90% equity / 10% debt.</li></ul></section><section id='key-recommendations'><h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2><ol><li><b>Proceed with the 60/40 Equity/Debt allocation</b> as it is well-aligned with the stated 'high_moderate' risk profile and 10-year time horizon.</li><li><b>Acknowledge Performance Dependency:</b> Achieving the ~₹5.1 Cr inflation-adjusted target is highly dependent on the equity portion of the portfolio generating average annual returns of approximately <b>13.7%</b>. This is an expectation, not a guarantee.</li><li><b>Prioritize Fund Selection:</b> When selecting specific mutual funds, prioritize those with a consistent track record of outperforming their respective benchmarks over 5-10 year periods to increase the probability of meeting the required return target.</li><li><b>Commit to the Correct SIP Amount:</b> Ensure future investments use the corrected monthly SIP amount of <b>₹2,41,120</b> to avoid a potential shortfall at the end of the investment term.</li></ol></section><section id='risk-factors'><h2>📉 Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2><p>This financial plan is based on projections and assumptions which are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. It is crucial to understand these factors. <i>The primary risk is that the assumed 11% blended return is not achieved.</i> The plan's success is heavily reliant on the equity component delivering ~13.7% annually; sustained market underperformance due to economic downturns, geopolitical events, or sector-specific issues could lead to a significant corpus shortfall. Secondly, <b>inflation risk</b> is a major concern; if the actual average inflation rate exceeds the projected 5.5%, the final corpus will have less purchasing power than intended, potentially jeopardizing retirement goals. Furthermore, the debt portion of the portfolio is subject to <b>interest rate risk</b>. While Government Securities carry no credit risk, their market value can decrease if interest rates rise, potentially leading to short-term capital losses. Finally, <b>investor behavior risk</b>, such as discontinuing SIPs during market downturns or making emotional investment decisions, can severely derail the plan. Consistency and discipline are paramount to navigating the 10-year journey successfully.</p></section><section id='sip-charts'><h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation Charts</h2><div

This is an expectation, not a guarantee.</li>\n            <li><b>Prioritize Fund Selection:</b> When selecting specific mutual funds, prioritize those with a consistent track record of outperforming their respective benchmarks over 5-10 year periods.</li>\n            <li><b>Commit to the Correct SIP Amount:</b> Ensure future investments use the corrected monthly SIP amount of <b>₹2,41,120</b> to avoid a potential shortfall at the end of the investment term.</li>\n        </ol>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"risk-factors\">\n        <h2>📉 Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2>\n        <p>This financial plan is based on projections and assumptions which are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. It is crucial to understand these factors. <i>The primary risk is that the assumed 11% blended return is not achieved.</i> The plan's success is heavily reliant on the equity component delivering ~13.7% annually; sustained market underperformance due to economic downturns, geopolitical events, or sector-specific issues could lead to a significant corpus shortfall. Secondly, <b>inflation risk</b> is a major concern; if the actual average inflation rate exceeds the projected 5.5%, the final corpus will have less purchasing power than intended, potentially jeopardizing retirement goals. Furthermore, the debt portion of the portfolio is subject to <b>interest rate risk</b>. While Government Securities carry no credit risk, their market value can decrease if interest rates rise. Finally, <b>investor behavior risk</b>, such as discontinuing SIPs during market downturns or making emotional investment decisions, can severely derail the plan. Consistency and discipline are paramount to navigating the 10-year journey successfully.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"allocation-notes\">\n        <h2>📝 Allocation Risk Profile Notes</h2>\n        <p>The chosen 'High-Moderate' allocation fits within a spectrum of risk-based strategies.
