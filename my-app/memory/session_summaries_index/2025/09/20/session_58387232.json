ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK: (1) Construct a goal-specific portfolio adhering to the 50/50 Equity/Debt allocation. (2) Formulate a detailed rebalancing methodology (e.g., annual or deviation-based). (3) Design a phase-based de-risking glide path, systematically reducing equity exposure from 50% to 40% in years 8-10. (4) Outline tax efficiency optimizations (LTCG planning, ELSS integration). (5) Model timeline scenarios for early or delayed retirement and their impact. OUTPUT: A comprehensive `fund_strategy_json` detailing the portfolio, rebalancing rules, glide path, tax strategy, and scenario analysis.",

(3) Risk Consistency: Ensure all selected funds align with the 'Moderate' risk profile. (4) Goal Alignment: Confirm the strategy, including the glide path, is appropriate for a 10-year retirement horizon.
