Ranking and scoring algorithms- Comparative analysis and explanations- Chart generation and reporting**Preparation Requirements:**- Prepare JSON outputs for fund performance charts using CoderAgent- Prepare data for top fund recommendations table using CoderAgent  - Generate fund allocation breakdown using CoderAgent- Create risk-return scatter plots using derived parameters## 🎯 USER SCENARIOProcess fund recommendations based on SIP-derived investment profile:**Input Data Structure:**```json{  \"investment_profile\": {    \"goal_type\": \"retirement\",    \"risk_appetite\": \"high\",     \"time_horizon\": 10,    \"monthly_sip_required\": 222765.73,    \"target_amount_inflation_adjusted\": 51244333.71,    \"assumed_annual_return\": 0.12  },  \"asset_allocation\": {    \"equity_percent\": 70,    \"debt_percent\": 30,    \"allocation_strategy\": \"aggressive_growth_with_stability\"  },  \"portfolio_requirements\": {    \"total_monthly_amount\": 222765.73,    \"equity_monthly_amount\": 155936.01,     \"debt_monthly_amount\": 66829.72  }}```## 🧮 COMPUTE (DETERMINISTIC)**Risk Profile Mapping:**```json{  \"risk_to_fund_weights\": {    \"very_low\": {\"cagr\": 0.05, \"sharpe\": 0.35, \"expense\": 0.35, \"rating\": 0.25},    \"low\": {\"cagr\": 0.10, \"sharpe\": 0.30, \"expense\": 0.30, \"rating\": 0.30},    \"low_moderate\": {\"cagr\": 0.15, \"sharpe\": 0.25, \"expense\": 0.25, \"rating\": 0.35},    \"moderate\": {\"cagr\": 0.25, \"sharpe\": 0.25, \"expense\": 0.20, \"rating\": 0.30},    \"high_moderate\": {\"cagr\": 0.35, \"sharpe\": 0.20, \"expense\": 0.15, \"rating\": 0.30},    \"high\": {\"cagr\": 0.40, \"sharpe\": 0.15, \"expense\": 0.10, \"rating\": 0.15},    \"very_high\": {\"cagr\": 0.45, \"sharpe\": 0.10, \"expense\": 0.05, \"rating\": 0.10}  }}```**Goal-Specific Adjustments:**- **Retirement**: Conservative progression with age-based allocation- **Child Education**: Growth-oriented with education timeline weighting  - **Wealth Creation**: Maximum growth focus with aggressive allocation- **House Purchase**: Liquidity-focused with shorter duration emphasis## 📋 DO (STEP-BY-STEP)1. **Input Normalization** → Emit `fund_input_profile_json`2. **Fund Data Retrieval** → Call RetrieverAgent for fund datasets  3. **Performance Analysis** → Refer \"Performance & Risk Computation\" from FundRecommendationAgent4. **Risk-Weighted Scoring** → Refer \"Ranking Algorithm\" from FundRecommendationAgent  5. **Fund Selection** → Refer \"Goal-Adaptive Selection\" from FundRecommendationAgent6. **Output Generation** → Emit structured fund recommendation JSONs**Fund Category Guidelines by Risk Appetite:**```json{  \"category_guidelines\": {    \"very_low\": \"Ultra conservative → 90% Liquid/Ultra Short Duration, 10% Large Cap\",    \"low\": \"Conservative → 70% Short/Medium Duration, 30% Large Cap/Conservative Hybrid\",    \"low_moderate\": \"Moderate Conservative → 60% Medium Duration/Hybrid, 40% Large Cap\",    \"moderate\": \"Balanced → 50% Large Cap/Flexi Cap, 50% Medium Duration/Aggressive Hybrid\",     \"high_moderate\": \"Growth Oriented → 60% Large/Mid Cap, 40% Corporate Bond/Hybrid\",    \"high\": \"Aggressive Growth → 70% Large/Mid/Small Cap, 30% Medium Duration\",    \"very_high\": \"Maximum Growth → 90% Mid/Small Cap/International, 10% Liquid\"  }}```**Validation Hooks:** - Validate fund data completeness and quality- Ensure performance metrics are properly computed- Verify allocation percentages sum to 100%- Check risk-return alignment with investor profile## 📊 VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS**Charts for ReportGeneratorAgent:**- **Fund Performance Chart** → Historical NAV trends for top recommendations- **Risk-Return Scatter** → Plot funds by risk vs return metrics- **Category Allocation** → Breakdown by equity/debt sub-categories  - **Expense Ratio Comparison** → Cost analysis across recommended funds**Strictness:** Recommend specific fund names with complete analysis. Include fund codes, NAV data, performance metrics, and rationale.## 📁 SCHEMAS### fund_input_profile_json```json{  \"goal_type\": \"string\",  \"risk_appetite\": \"string\",   \"time_horizon_years\": \"number\",  \"monthly_investment\": \"number\",  \"target_corpus\": \"number\",  \"currency\": \"INR\",  \"allocation_equity_pct\": \"number\",  \"allocation_debt_pct\": \"number\"}```### fund_master_json```json[  {    \"fund_code\": \"string\",    \"fund_name\": \"string\",     \"category\": \"string\",    \"aum_cr\": \"number\",    \"expense_ratio\": \"number\",    \"nav_latest\": \"number\",    \"ratings\": {      \"crisil_rank\": \"number\",       \"morningstar\": \"number\",      \"value_research\": \"number\"    }  }]```### fund_performance_json  ```json[  {    \"fund_code\": \"string\",    \"fund_name\": \"string\",    \"cagr_1y\": \"number\",    \"cagr_3y\": \"number\",     \"cagr_5y\": \"number\",    \"std_dev\": \"number\",    \"sharpe\": \"number\",    \"sortino\": \"number\",    \"max_drawdown\": \"number\",    \"alpha\": \"number\",    \"beta\": \"number\"  }]```### fund_ranking_json```json[  {    \"fund_code\": \"string\",    \"fund_name\": \"string\",    \"category\": \"string\",    \"risk_profile\": \"string\",    \"weighted_score\": \"number\",     \"rank\": \"number\",    \"recommended_allocation_pct\": \"number\",    \"monthly_investment_amount\": \"number\"  }]```### fund_portfolio_json```json{  \"equity_funds\": [    {      \"fund_name\": \"string\",      \"allocation_pct\": \"number\",      \"monthly_amount\": \"number\",       \"rationale\": \"string\"    }  ],  \"debt_funds\": [    {      \"fund_name\": \"string\",       \"allocation_pct\": \"number\",      \"monthly_amount\": \"number\",      \"rationale\": \"string\"    }  ],  \"total_equity_allocation\": \"number\",  \"total_debt_allocation\": \"number\"}```### fund_analysis_json```json{  \"top_picks\": {    \"equity\": \"string[]\",    \"debt\": \"string[]\"  },  \"key_insights\": \"string[]\",  \"risk_considerations\": \"string[]\",   \"performance_expectations\": {    \"expected_cagr\": \"number\",    \"volatility_range\": \"string\",    \"downside_protection\": \"string\"  },  \"rebalancing_guidance\": {    \"frequency\": \"string\",    \"triggers\": \"string[]\",     \"methodology\": \"string\"  }}```## 🎯 OUTPUTS REQUIREDEmit **STRICT JSON** (no prose, no markdown):1. **fund_input_profile_json**2. **fund_master_json** 3. **fund_performance_json**4. **fund_ranking_json**5. **fund_portfolio_json**6. **fund_analysis_json**## 🔄 INTEGRATION FLOW```mermaidgraph TD    A[SIP Analysis Input] --> B[Fund Input Profile]    B --> C[RetrieverAgent: Fund Data]    C --> D[FundRecommendationAgent: Analysis]    D --> E[Performance Computation]    E --> F[Risk-Weighted Ranking]     F --> G[Portfolio Construction]    G --> H[CoderAgent: Charts]    H --> I[ReportGeneratorAgent: Final Output]    I --> J[QAAgent: Validation]```====================================================================## 📋 MANDATORY REPORT SECTIONS FOR FUND RECOMMENDATION REPORTS====================================================================All orchestrations and plan graphs must ensure downstream agents enforce the following sections in the final **fund_recommendation_report.html**:### Required Sections:1. **Executive Summary** -
