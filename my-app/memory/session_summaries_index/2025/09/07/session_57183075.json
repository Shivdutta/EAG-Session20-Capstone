First, I will calculate the future value of the target amount after adjusting for 5.5% annual inflation. Next, I will determine the required monthly SIP using the provided formula and a 12% annual return rate (corresponding to 'high' risk). Then, I will create the asset allocation plan (70% equity, 30% debt) and list recommended fund categories. Finally, I will generate the complete 120-month projection table using the mandatory compound interest algorithm: `balance = balance * (1 + r) + S` for each month.

The output must be a single JSON object for `fund_shortlist.json`. I need to handle malformed or unusable content gracefully, as many of the provided text blobs are error messages or content-limited. I will focus on extracting data from the more structured sources like 'etmoney.com' and 'groww.in'. For each fund, I will capture its name, category, available metrics, and the source URL. Finally, I must include the mandatory `processing_status` and `quality_assessment` blocks, being honest about the limitations of parsing such messy data.",

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\n### **1. Introduction: Bridging Strategy and Execution**\n\nThe investment plan for achieving a retirement corpus of INR 3 Crore (inflation-adjusted to INR 5.12 Crore) over 10 years is built on a strategic asset allocation of 70% in equity and 30% in debt. This allocation is designed to align with a 'high' risk appetite, prioritizing capital growth to outpace inflation and build a substantial corpus. The provided fund shortlist contains examples of investment vehicles that can be used to implement this strategy. This analysis serves as a crucial bridge, explaining how the shortlisted fund categories align with the strategic allocation and work in concert to meet the user's financial goal.\n\nIt is critical to understand that this reconciliation is for educational and analytical purposes. The specific funds mentioned are used as examples to represent their respective categories and do not constitute a direct investment recommendation. Portfolio construction requires further due diligence and should ideally be guided by a qualified financial advisor.\n\n### **2. The Equity Allocation (70%): The Engine of Growth**\n\nThe 70% allocation to equity is the portfolio's primary growth driver. Over a 10-year horizon, equity has historically demonstrated the potential to deliver superior inflation-adjusted returns compared to other asset classes. Given the 'high' risk tolerance, the portfolio can withstand the short-to-medium term volatility inherent in equity markets in pursuit of higher long-term returns. The allocation plan wisely diversifies this equity exposure across different market capitalizations to balance risk and optimize growth potential.\n\n#### **2.1. Large-Cap Funds: The Foundation of Stability**\n\n*   **Strategic Role:** Large-cap funds invest in the top 100 publicly listed companies in India by market capitalization. These are established, well-researched companies with stable earnings, strong balance sheets, and often, a history of paying dividends. Within the equity portion, large-cap funds serve as the core or foundation, providing relative stability and consistent, albeit moderate, growth. They tend to be less volatile than mid-cap and small-cap stocks, offering a degree of resilience during market downturns.\n*   **Alignment with Goal:** For a retirement portfolio, large-cap funds provide the steady compounding necessary to form the bulk of the equity corpus without exposing the entire portfolio to excessive risk. They are the dependable workhorses of the equity allocation.\n*   **Shortlist Reconciliation:** The shortlist includes funds such as **Nippon India Large Cap Fund** and **ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund**. These funds exemplify the category by holding portfolios of blue-chip Indian companies, thereby fitting the role of providing foundational stability and growth to the 70% equity allocation.\n\n#### **2.2. Mid-Cap Funds: The Growth Accelerator**\n\n*   **Strategic Role:** Mid-cap funds invest in companies that are smaller than large-caps but more established than small-caps (typically ranked 101-250 by market capitalization). These companies are often in a high-growth phase, expanding their market share and operations. Consequently, mid-cap funds offer a higher growth potential than large-cap funds, but this comes with a corresponding increase in volatility and risk.\n*   **Alignment with Goal:** Given the 'high' risk appetite and a 10-year timeline to absorb volatility, including mid-cap funds is essential for accelerating corpus growth. They act as a 'kicker' to the portfolio's returns, helping to reach the ambitious retirement target more effectively.\n*   **Shortlist Reconciliation:** Funds like **Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund** and **Invesco India Mid Cap Fund** from the shortlist are prime examples. Their investment mandate is to identify and invest in these emerging leaders, making them suitable for fulfilling the growth acceleration role within the equity sleeve.\n\n#### **2.3. Small-Cap Funds: The High-Alpha Component**\n\n*   **Strategic Role:** Small-cap funds invest in companies beyond the top 250 by market capitalization. These are often young, undiscovered companies with the potential for explosive growth (and also the risk of failure). This category offers the highest potential for 'alpha' generation (returns above the market average) but is also the most volatile and riskiest segment of the equity market.\n*   **Alignment with Goal:** An allocation to small-cap funds is a direct reflection of the investor's 'high' risk tolerance. Over a 10-year period, there is sufficient time for the high-risk, high-return thesis of small-cap investing to play out. This component is designed to significantly boost overall portfolio returns, provided the investor can stomach the significant price swings.\n*   **Shortlist Reconciliation:** The shortlist provides several examples, including **Nippon India Small Cap Fund**, **SBI Small Cap Fund**, and the index-based **Motilal Oswal Nifty Smallcap 250 Index Fund**. These funds provide exposure to the high-octane segment of the market, perfectly aligning with the aggressive growth objective of the investment plan.\n\n### **3. The Debt Allocation (30%): The Anchor of Stability**\n\nThe 30% allocation to debt instruments is the portfolio's anchor. Its primary role is not to generate high returns but to provide stability, preserve capital, and reduce the overall volatility of the portfolio. During periods of equity market correction, the debt portion acts as a cushion, mitigating downside risk. It provides psychological comfort and ensures the portfolio's risk profile remains aligned with the investor's tolerance.\n\n#### **3.1. Corporate Bond Funds: The Yield Enhancer**\n\n*   **Strategic Role:** These funds primarily invest in debt securities issued by private and public sector companies. They carry a higher credit risk than government securities and, therefore, offer higher potential yields. They provide a source of stable accrual income and are less sensitive to interest rate changes compared to long-duration gilt funds.\n*   **Alignment with Goal:** Within the debt portion, corporate bond funds serve to enhance yield slightly without taking on the volatility of equity. They provide a stable, predictable return component that helps in the steady accumulation of the corpus.\n*   **Shortlist Reconciliation:** The shortlisted **Nippon India Corporate Bond Fund** and **Axis Corporate Bond Fund** are representative of this category. They would invest in a diversified portfolio of corporate bonds, fulfilling the role of a stable yield-enhancer in the debt allocation.\n\n#### **3.2. Short Duration Funds: The Liquidity & Safety Net**\n\n*   **Strategic Role:** Short duration funds invest in debt and money market instruments such that the portfolio's Macaulay duration is between 1 to 3 years. This makes them less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations compared to funds with longer durations. Their primary role is capital preservation and providing liquidity.\n*   **Alignment with Goal:** These funds provide a very stable and predictable component to the debt portfolio. They act as a safety net, offering low volatility and cushioning the portfolio against both equity market shocks and interest rate risk. They are a core component for managing overall portfolio risk.\n*   **Shortlist Reconciliation:** Examples like the **Bank of India Short Term Income Fund** and **Sundaram Short Duration Fund** from the shortlist align perfectly with this role. They prioritize safety and low volatility, making them suitable for the most conservative part of the 30% debt allocation.",

Over a 10-year horizon, equity has historically demonstrated the potential to deliver superior inflation-adjusted returns. Given the 'high' risk tolerance, the portfolio can withstand short-to-medium term volatility in pursuit of higher long-term returns.</p>\n      <h3>The Debt Allocation (30%): The Anchor of Stability</h3>\n      <p>The 30% allocation to debt instruments is the portfolio's anchor. Its primary role is not to generate high returns but to provide stability, preserve capital, and reduce the overall volatility of the portfolio. During periods of equity market correction, the debt portion acts as a cushion.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"key-recommendations\">\n      <h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li><b>Build an All-Weather Portfolio:</b> Understand that the purpose of diversifying across these fund categories is to build a resilient portfolio. The equity components are designed for growth during market upswings, while the debt components are designed to provide a cushion during downturns.</li>\n        <li><b>Calibrate Internal Equity Allocation:</b> The allocation within the 70% equity portion (i.e., how much goes into large, mid, and small-cap respectively) should be determined by a finer assessment of risk tolerance. A more aggressive stance would overweight mid and small-caps, while a more moderate stance would favour large-caps.</li>\n        <li><b>Address the Shortfall:</b> Immediately consider a minor upward revision of the monthly SIP (approx. 1%) to compensate for the identified projection shortfall and ensure the final goal is met.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"risk-factors\">\n      <h2>📉 Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2>\n      <p>Investing in capital markets involves inherent risks. This plan, while based on statistical models, is subject to various market and execution risks that must be fully understood.</p>\n      <div class=\"callout warning\">⚠️ <b>Calculation Precision Risk:</b> As identified in the Quality Assurance review, the current projection model results in a final corpus that is <b>₹5,09,662.19 short</b> of the required target. This highlights the risk of minor precision errors in calculations compounding over a long period. <i>Mitigation: The monthly SIP should be marginally increased to compensate for this shortfall and a periodic review should be conducted to ensure the plan is on track.</i></div>\n      <ul>\n        <li><b>Market Volatility Risk:</b> The 70% allocation to equity, particularly with exposure to mid and small-cap funds, will lead to significant fluctuations in portfolio value. Investors must be prepared for periods of negative returns and avoid making panic-driven decisions. The 'high' risk appetite implies a capacity to withstand this volatility over the 10-year horizon. <i>Mitigation: Adherence to the SIP discipline helps average out purchase costs over time (Rupee Cost Averaging) and reduces the impact of timing the market.</i></li>\n        <li><b>Underperformance Risk:</b> The assumed 12% annualized return is a projection, not a guarantee. There is a risk that the selected funds or the market as a whole may underperform this expectation, which would result in a lower-than-expected final corpus. <i>Mitigation: Diversifying across multiple fund houses and categories can reduce fund-specific risk. A yearly review of the portfolio's performance against benchmarks is crucial.</i></li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n      <h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation

Generate a detailed asset allocation plan based on the 'high' risk guideline (70% equity / 30% debt) and recommend appropriate fund categories. 5. Generate a full month-by-month projection table.

            "detailed": "Let me think through this: \n\n### **1. Introduction: Bridging Strategy and Execution**\n\nThe investment plan for achieving a retirement corpus of INR 3 Crore (inflation-adjusted to INR 5.12 Crore) over 10 years is built on a strategic asset allocation of 70% in equity and 30% in debt. This allocation is designed to align with a 'high' risk appetite, prioritizing capital growth to outpace inflation and build a substantial corpus. The provided fund shortlist contains examples of investment vehicles that can be used to implement this strategy. This analysis serves as a crucial bridge, explaining how the shortlisted fund categories align with the strategic allocation and work in concert to meet the user's financial goal.\n\nIt is critical to understand that this reconciliation is for educational and analytical purposes. The specific funds mentioned are used as examples to represent their respective categories and do not constitute a direct investment recommendation. Portfolio construction requires further due diligence and should ideally be guided by a qualified financial advisor.\n\n### **2. The Equity Allocation (70%): The Engine of Growth**\n\nThe 70% allocation to equity is the portfolio's primary growth driver. Over a 10-year horizon, equity has historically demonstrated the potential to deliver superior inflation-adjusted returns compared to other asset classes. Given the 'high' risk tolerance, the portfolio can withstand the short-to-medium term volatility inherent in equity markets in pursuit of higher long-term returns. The allocation plan wisely diversifies this equity exposure across different market capitalizations to balance risk and optimize growth potential.\n\n#### **2.1. Large-Cap Funds: The Foundation of Stability**\n\n*   **Strategic Role:** Large-cap funds invest in the top 100 publicly listed companies in India by market capitalization. These are established, well-researched companies with stable earnings, strong balance sheets, and often, a history of paying dividends. Within the equity portion, large-cap funds serve as the core or foundation, providing relative stability and consistent, albeit moderate, growth. They tend to be less volatile than mid-cap and small-cap stocks, offering a degree of resilience during market downturns.\n*   **Alignment with Goal:** For a retirement portfolio, large-cap funds provide the steady compounding necessary to form the bulk of the equity corpus without exposing the entire portfolio to excessive risk. They are the dependable workhorses of the equity allocation.\n*   **Shortlist Reconciliation:** The shortlist includes funds such as **Nippon India Large Cap Fund** and **ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund**. These funds exemplify the category by holding portfolios of blue-chip Indian companies, thereby fitting the role of providing foundational stability and growth to the 70% equity allocation.\n\n#### **2.2. Mid-Cap Funds: The Growth Accelerator**\n\n*   **Strategic Role:** Mid-cap funds invest in companies that are smaller than large-caps but more established than small-caps (typically ranked 101-250 by market capitalization). These companies are often in a high-growth phase, expanding their market share and operations. Consequently, mid-cap funds offer a higher growth potential than large-cap funds, but this comes with a corresponding increase in volatility and risk.\n*   **Alignment with Goal:** Given the 'high' risk appetite and a 10-year timeline to absorb volatility, including mid-cap funds is essential for accelerating corpus growth. They act as a 'kicker' to the portfolio's returns, helping to reach the ambitious retirement target more effectively.\n*   **Shortlist Reconciliation:** Funds like **Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund** and **Invesco India Mid Cap Fund** from the shortlist are prime examples. Their investment mandate is to identify and invest in these emerging leaders, making them suitable for fulfilling the growth acceleration role within the equity sleeve.\n\n#### **2.3. Small-Cap Funds: The High-Alpha Component**\n\n*   **Strategic Role:** Small-cap funds invest in companies beyond the top 250 by market capitalization. These are often young, undiscovered companies with the potential for explosive growth (and also the risk of failure). This category offers the highest potential for 'alpha' generation (returns above the market average) but is also the most volatile and riskiest segment of the equity market.\n*   **Alignment with Goal:** An allocation to small-cap funds is a direct reflection of the investor's 'high' risk tolerance. Over a 10-year period, there is sufficient time for the high-risk, high-return thesis of small-cap investing to play out. This component is designed to significantly boost overall portfolio returns, provided the investor can stomach the significant price swings.\n*   **Shortlist Reconciliation:** The shortlist provides several examples, including **Nippon India Small Cap Fund**, **SBI Small Cap Fund**, and the index-based **Motilal Oswal Nifty Smallcap 250 Index Fund**. These funds provide exposure to the high-octane segment of the market, perfectly aligning with the aggressive growth objective of the investment plan.\n\n### **3. The Debt Allocation (30%): The Anchor of Stability**\n\nThe 30% allocation to debt instruments is the portfolio's anchor. Its primary role is not to generate high returns but to provide stability, preserve capital, and reduce the overall volatility of the portfolio. During periods of equity market correction, the debt portion acts as a cushion, mitigating downside risk. It provides psychological comfort and ensures the portfolio's risk profile remains aligned with the investor's tolerance.\n\n#### **3.1. Corporate Bond Funds: The Yield Enhancer**\n\n*   **Strategic Role:** These funds primarily invest in debt securities issued by private and public sector companies. They carry a higher credit risk than government securities and, therefore, offer higher potential yields. They provide a source of stable accrual income and are less sensitive to interest rate changes compared to long-duration gilt funds.\n*   **Alignment with Goal:** Within the debt portion, corporate bond funds serve to enhance yield slightly without taking on the volatility of equity. They provide a stable, predictable return component that helps in the steady accumulation of the corpus.\n*   **Shortlist Reconciliation:** The shortlisted **Nippon India Corporate Bond Fund** and **Axis Corporate Bond Fund** are representative of this category. They would invest in a diversified portfolio of corporate bonds, fulfilling the role of a stable yield-enhancer in the debt allocation.\n\n#### **3.2. Short Duration Funds: The Liquidity & Safety Net**\n\n*   **Strategic Role:** Short duration funds invest in debt and money market instruments such that the portfolio's Macaulay duration is between 1 to 3 years. This makes them less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations compared to funds with longer durations. Their primary role is capital preservation and providing liquidity.\n*   **Alignment with Goal:** These funds provide a very stable and predictable component to the debt portfolio. They act as a safety net, offering low volatility and cushioning the portfolio against both equity market shocks and interest rate risk. They are a core component for managing overall portfolio risk.\n*   **Shortlist Reconciliation:** Examples like the **Bank of India Short Term Income Fund** and **Sundaram Short Duration Fund** from the shortlist align perfectly with this role. They prioritize safety and low volatility, making them suitable for the most conservative part of the 30% debt allocation.",

However, the provided projection table, using that same monthly SIP, results in a final corpus of only 50,734,671.52 INR at month 120.

After adjusting for an annual inflation rate of 5.5%, the future value of the target corpus is calculated to be <b>₹5,12,44,333.71</b>. To meet this ambitious goal, a monthly SIP of <b>₹2,22,764.04</b> is required, assuming an annualized return of 12%.</p><p>The strategic asset allocation is aggressive, with <b>70% allocated to Equity</b> for high growth potential and <b>30% to Debt</b> for portfolio stability and capital preservation.

Over a 10-year horizon, equity has historically demonstrated the potential to deliver superior inflation-adjusted returns. Given the 'high' risk tolerance, the portfolio can withstand short-to-medium term volatility in pursuit of higher long-term returns.</p><h3>The Debt Allocation (30%): The Anchor of Stability</h3><p>The 30% allocation to debt instruments is the portfolio's anchor. Its primary role is not to generate high returns but to provide stability, preserve capital, and reduce the overall volatility of the portfolio. During periods of equity market correction, the debt portion acts as a cushion.</p><div class='table-container'><table><caption>Strategic Role of Fund Categories</caption><thead><tr><th>Asset Class</th><th>Fund Category</th><th>Strategic Role in Portfolio</th><th>Risk Profile</th><th>Alignment with Retirement Goal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Equity (70%)</td><td>Large Cap Funds</td><td>Core holding for foundational stability and consistent growth.</td><td>Moderately High</td><td>Provides steady, long-term compounding from established companies.</td></tr><tr><td>Equity (70%)</td><td>Mid Cap Funds</td><td>Growth accelerator to boost overall portfolio returns.</td><td>High</td><td>Targets emerging companies to outperform inflation and achieve aggressive growth targets.</td></tr><tr><td>Equity (70%)</td><td>Small Cap Funds</td><td>High-alpha satellite component for maximum growth potential.</td><td>Very High</td><td>Reflects high-risk appetite to generate superior returns over a 10-year horizon.</td></tr><tr><td>Debt (30%)</td><td>Corporate Bond Funds</td><td>Yield enhancer for stable income and capital appreciation.</td><td>Low to Moderate</td><td>Provides better returns than safer debt options while adding stability.</td></tr><tr><td>Debt (30%)</td><td>Short Duration Funds</td><td>Anchor for capital preservation, liquidity, and risk mitigation.</td><td>Low</td><td>Reduces overall portfolio volatility and protects against interest rate risk.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id='key-recommendations'><h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2><ul><li><b>Build an All-Weather Portfolio:</b> Understand that the purpose of diversifying across these fund categories is to build a resilient portfolio. The equity components are designed for growth during market upswings, while the debt components are designed to provide a cushion during downturns.</li><li><b>Calibrate Internal Equity Allocation:</b> The allocation within the 70% equity portion (i.e., how much goes into large, mid, and small-cap respectively) should be determined by a finer assessment of risk tolerance. A more aggressive stance would overweight mid and small-caps, while a more moderate stance would favour large-caps.</li></ul></section><section id='risk-factors'><h2>📉 Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2><p>Investing in capital markets involves inherent risks. This plan, while based on statistical models, is subject to various market and execution risks that must be fully understood.</p><div class='callout warning'>⚠️ <b>Calculation Precision Risk:</b> As identified in the Quality Assurance review, the current projection model results in a final corpus that is <b>₹5,09,662.19 short</b> of the required target. This highlights the risk of minor precision errors in calculations compounding over a long period. <i>Mitigation: The monthly SIP should be marginally increased to compensate for this shortfall and a periodic review should be conducted to ensure the plan is on track.</i></div><ul><li><b>Market Volatility Risk:</b> The 70% allocation to equity, particularly with exposure to mid and small-cap funds, will lead to significant fluctuations in portfolio value. Investors must be prepared for periods of negative returns and avoid making panic-driven decisions. The 'high' risk appetite implies a capacity to withstand this volatility over the 10-year horizon. <i>Mitigation: Adherence to the SIP discipline helps average out purchase costs over time (Rupee Cost Averaging) and reduces the impact of timing the market.</i></li><li><b>Underperformance Risk:</b> The assumed 12% annualized return is a projection, not a guarantee. There is a risk that the selected funds or the market as a whole may underperform this expectation, which would result in a lower-than-expected final corpus. <i>Mitigation: Diversifying across multiple fund houses and categories can reduce fund-specific risk. A yearly review of the portfolio's performance against benchmarks is crucial.</i></li><li><b>Inflation Risk:</b> The plan assumes a 5.5% average annual inflation rate. If actual inflation is consistently higher, the real value (purchasing power) of the final corpus will be eroded, and the target amount may prove insufficient for retirement needs. <i>Mitigation: The high allocation to equity is the primary hedge against inflation, as equity returns have historically outpaced it over the long term.</i></li></ul></section><section id='sip-charts'><h2>📊 SIP

Over a 10-year horizon, equity has historically demonstrated the potential to deliver superior inflation-adjusted returns. Given the 'high' risk tolerance, the portfolio can withstand short-to-medium term volatility in pursuit of higher long-term returns.</p>\n      <h3>The Debt Allocation (30%): The Anchor of Stability</h3>\n      <p>The 30% allocation to debt instruments is the portfolio's anchor. Its primary role is not to generate high returns but to provide stability, preserve capital, and reduce the overall volatility of the portfolio. During periods of equity market correction, the debt portion acts as a cushion.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"key-recommendations\">\n      <h2>🔑 Key Recommendations</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li><b>Build an All-Weather Portfolio:</b> Understand that the purpose of diversifying across these fund categories is to build a resilient portfolio. The equity components are designed for growth during market upswings, while the debt components are designed to provide a cushion during downturns.</li>\n        <li><b>Calibrate Internal Equity Allocation:</b> The allocation within the 70% equity portion (i.e., how much goes into large, mid, and small-cap respectively) should be determined by a finer assessment of risk tolerance. A more aggressive stance would overweight mid and small-caps, while a more moderate stance would favour large-caps.</li>\n        <li><b>Address the Shortfall:</b> Immediately consider a minor upward revision of the monthly SIP (approx. 1%) to compensate for the identified projection shortfall and ensure the final goal is met.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"risk-factors\">\n      <h2>📉 Risk Factors and Uncertainties</h2>\n      <p>Investing in capital markets involves inherent risks. This plan, while based on statistical models, is subject to various market and execution risks that must be fully understood.</p>\n      <div class=\"callout warning\">⚠️ <b>Calculation Precision Risk:</b> As identified in the Quality Assurance review, the current projection model results in a final corpus that is <b>₹5,09,662.19 short</b> of the required target. This highlights the risk of minor precision errors in calculations compounding over a long period. <i>Mitigation: The monthly SIP should be marginally increased to compensate for this shortfall and a periodic review should be conducted to ensure the plan is on track.</i></div>\n      <ul>\n        <li><b>Market Volatility Risk:</b> The 70% allocation to equity, particularly with exposure to mid and small-cap funds, will lead to significant fluctuations in portfolio value. Investors must be prepared for periods of negative returns and avoid making panic-driven decisions. The 'high' risk appetite implies a capacity to withstand this volatility over the 10-year horizon. <i>Mitigation: Adherence to the SIP discipline helps average out purchase costs over time (Rupee Cost Averaging) and reduces the impact of timing the market.</i></li>\n        <li><b>Underperformance Risk:</b> The assumed 12% annualized return is a projection, not a guarantee. There is a risk that the selected funds or the market as a whole may underperform this expectation, which would result in a lower-than-expected final corpus. <i>Mitigation: Diversifying across multiple fund houses and categories can reduce fund-specific risk. A yearly review of the portfolio's performance against benchmarks is crucial.</i></li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"sip-charts\">\n      <h2>📊 SIP Projection & Allocation

The task should resume from an early stage of the plan to allow for re-evaluation; based on the provided examples, resuming from a step like 'T005' seems appropriate for a plan refresh.
