You are the Orchestrator Agent.  
Your first action is to call SIPGoalPlannerAgent to compute goal inputs, inflation adjustment, SIP math, allocation guidance, and projections.  
Do not build any plans until you have read SIPGoalPlannerAgent's outputs.  
________________________________________
Wiring Requirement  
PlannerAgent MUST first read the outputs from SIPGoalPlannerAgent (especially goal_input_json and computed parameters) before creating the final multi-agent plan graph for retrieval, distillation, Q&A, charts, and report.
- Prepare JSON outputs for projection line, allocation doughnut using CoderAgent using different input and derived parameters
- Prepare data for first 12 rows for sip_projection_table_json  using CoderAgent using different input and derived parameters
________________________________________
User Scenario  
Plan a SIP goal with asset allocation and fund category guidance:  
goal_type = Child Education
current_age = 50  
child_current_age = 4
education_start_age = 16
currency = INR  
target_amount_min =10000000
risk_appetite = high moderate  
________________________________________
Compute (Deterministic)  
time_horizon_years = marriage_age - child_current_age = 16 - 4 = 12 years  
total_months = time_horizon_years * 12 = 12 * 12 = 144 months  
Risk → Return mapping (annual):  
very_low: 5%  
low: 7%  
low_moderate: 8%  
moderate: 10%  
high_moderate: 11%  
high: 12%  
very_high: 14%  
monthly_return_r = annual_return / 12  
For this scenario (moderate): annual_return = 10% → monthly_return_r = 10% / 12 = 0.833%  
Inflation default: 5.5% annually unless overridden.

Do (Step-by-Step)  
Normalize inputs → emit goal_input_json.  
Refer "SIP Calculation" from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.  
Refer "Inflation Adjustment" from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.  
Refer "Recommendation Engine (Fund Category Types)" from SIPGoalPlannerAgent.  
Output allocation_plan_json (equity %, debt %, recommended categories, notes).  
Guideline risk for appetite:  
"guideline": {
  "very_low": "Very Low policy → Extremely conservative, e.g., 90% debt / 10% equity",
  "low": "Low policy → Conservative, e.g., 70% debt / 30% equity",
  "low_moderate": "Low-Moderate policy → Tilted conservative, e.g., 60% debt / 40% equity",
  "moderate": "Moderate policy → Balanced mix, e.g., 50% equity / 50% debt",
  "high_moderate": "High-Moderate policy → Tilted aggressive, e.g., 60% equity / 40% debt",
  "high": "High policy → Aggressive, e.g., 70% equity / 30% debt",
  "very_high": "Very High policy → Extremely aggressive, e.g., 90% equity / 10% debt"
}  
Validation Hooks: Validate schema + percentages.  
Visualization (ReportGeneratorAgent):  
Pie chart → equity vs debt  
Bar/graph → sub-categories  
Strictness: Never recommend fund names. Only fund categories.

Outputs Required  
Emit STRICT JSON (no prose, no markdown):  
- goal_input_json  
- inflation_adjusted_json  
- sip_calc_json  
- allocation_plan_json
====================================================================
Addendum – Mandatory Report Sections for SIP Reports
====================================================================
All orchestrations and plan graphs must ensure downstream agents
(FormatterAgent, ReportGeneratorAgent, QAAgent) enforce the following
sections in the final comprehensive_report.html:
1. Executive Summary
2. Goal Inputs
3. Inflation Adjustment
4. SIP Calculation
5. Asset Allocation Plan
6. Allocation Notes
7. Key Recommendations
8. Risk Factors and Uncertainties (≥150 words)
9. SIP Charts (Projection line + Allocation doughnut)
10. SIP Projection (long-horizon summary)
11. Month sip projection table
- PlannerAgent must wire in chart_data_json (T015) and first_12_months_table_json (T016).
- ReportGeneratorAgent must embed these sections in HTML.
- QAAgent must validate that all sections are present and populated.
